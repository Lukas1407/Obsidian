> Sensory receptors are specialized cells located throughout the body that detect changes in the environment (both internal and external) and convey this information to the nervous system. They play a crucial role in providing feedback on various physiological states and environmental stimuli:

## Types of Sensory Receptors:
### ![[Mechanoreceptors]]
### Thermoreceptors
- Sense changes in temperature, either heat or cold.
### ![[Nociceptors]]
### ![[Proprioceptors]]
### Chemoreceptors
- Detect chemical stimuli that can also be perceived as taste or smell on the skin.

## How Sensory Information is Processed
1. **Pathway**:
    - Information from these receptors is collected and transmitted to the spinal cord via sensory neurons.
    - The sensory neurons connect directly to the spinal cord, where initial processing occurs. This pathway allows the body to respond rapidly to changes in the environment.
2. **Integration in the Spinal Cord**:
    - Once in the spinal cord, the sensory information can be processed locally for quick reflex actions or relayed to the brain for more complex processing.
    - This enables the central nervous system (CNS) to adjust or initiate motor responses appropriately, ensuring that body movements are well-coordinated and adaptive to the situation.
