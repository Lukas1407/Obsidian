> [!abstract] Definition
Proprioceptors are sensory receptors in the musculoskeletal system that transform mechanical distortion in the muscle or joint, such as any change in joint position, muscle length or muscle tension, into nerve impulses that enter the spinal cord and stimulate a motor response.

## Types
### Muscle Spindles
- **Location and Structure**: Embedded parallel to muscle fibers, these proprioceptors contain intrafusal fibers that adjust their sensitivity via Î³ (gamma) efferent nerves.
- **Function**: Sensitive to changes in muscle length, they send signals through Ia afferent nerves to the spinal cord to initiate reflexive adjustments in muscle tension.
### Golgi Tendon Organs
- **Location**: Found at the junctions between muscles and tendons.
- **Function**: These receptors monitor muscle tension and force. When stretched, they help modulate muscle activity to prevent damage from excessive force, also contributing to the sensation of force and heaviness.
### Joint Receptors
- **Ruffini Endings**: Respond to changes in joint angle and the velocity of joint movements.
- **Pacinian Corpuscles**: Besides detecting rapid vibrations, they can also sense pressure changes within joints.
