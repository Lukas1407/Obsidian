Web services are a core component of modern web architectures, enabling applications to communicate and share data over the internet, irrespective of the platforms and languages involved in their development. IBM's definition encapsulates the fundamental characteristics and functionalities of web services, emphasizing their autonomous, interoperable, and modular nature. 
### Self-Contained
- **Explanation**: Web services encapsulate specific business logic or functionalities within a well-defined boundary. This means that all the necessary data and logic to perform a task are included within the web service.
- **Impact**: This containment allows web services to operate independently of other services, enhancing reliability and ease of use.

### Self-Describing
- **Explanation**: Web services provide a machine-readable description of their interfaces, typically using standards such as WSDL (Web Services Description Language). This description specifies how to interact with the web service, including details about operations available, the messages to be used, and the protocols supported.
- **Impact**: Such descriptions enable other systems and services to understand and interact with them without prior manual setup or human intervention, facilitating dynamic discovery and binding.

### Modular
- **Explanation**: Web services are designed to be modular, meaning they perform specific functions that can be used independently or combined with other services to create more comprehensive solutions.
- **Impact**: This modularity supports reusability and composition, allowing developers to build complex applications more quickly by integrating existing services.

### Published
- **Explanation**: Web services are published to one or more service registries where potential users can find them. This is often compared to listing a service in an electronic "yellow pages."
- **Impact**: Publishing services in this way makes them discoverable, which is essential for enabling the composition of new applications from existing services.

### Located
- **Explanation**: Each web service has a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that provides a global address for accessing it.
- **Impact**: The URI allows the web service to be located and invoked across the internet. This fixed address simplifies the process of integrating and using the service in diverse applications.

### Invoked
- **Explanation**: Web services use standard Internet protocols such as HTTP, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), or REST (Representational State Transfer) for communication.
- **Impact**: Using standard protocols ensures that web services can be easily invoked and integrated with different systems, platforms, and programming languages, fostering interoperability.

### Relationship to Components
- As noted by Reussner, web services can be viewed as deployed components. They encapsulate functionality, expose interfaces, and are managed independently, similar to how software components are designed and used within applications. The key difference is that web services are specifically designed for operation over a network, particularly the internet.

### Conclusion
Web services form the backbone of distributed computing on the internet, enabling disparate systems to communicate and cooperate seamlessly. They are essential for building scalable, distributed applications that leverage functionality from multiple sources across the web. By adhering to standards for description, discovery, and communication, web services ensure that developers can easily use and integrate diverse functionalities into their applications, enhancing development speed and reducing costs.
