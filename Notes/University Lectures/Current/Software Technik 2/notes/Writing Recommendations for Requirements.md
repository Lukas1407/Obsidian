### Basic Writing Recommendations for Requirements:

**1. Use Clear and Simple Sentences:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure requirements are easy to understand for all stakeholders.
   - **Guideline:** Write short, concise sentences with one clear requirement per sentence.
   - **Example:**
     - **BAD:** "The Navigation system navigates to a destination with comfortable usability."
     - **GOOD:** "The navigation system must allow the user to set the destination in all modes."

**2. Use Active Language:**
   - **Objective:** Clearly specify responsibilities and actions.
   - **Guideline:** Use active voice to make it clear who is responsible for what action.
   - **Example:**
     - **BAD:** "When the PIN was validated, money can be withdrawn from the account."
     - **GOOD:** "When the ATM has validated the PIN, the customer can withdraw money from their account."

**3. Avoid Weak Words:**
   - **Objective:** Remove ambiguity and ensure clarity in requirements.
   - **Guideline:** Avoid using vague terms like "effective," "user-friendly," "easy," "quickly," "timely," "reliable," and "appropriate."
   - **Example:** Instead of saying "The system should be user-friendly," specify what "user-friendly" means in measurable terms.

**4. Maintain a Glossary:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure consistent use of terminology throughout the project.
   - **Guideline:** Develop and adhere to a glossary of terms.
   - **Example:** Define terms like "user," "admin," "system," etc., and use these terms consistently.

**5. Use Sentence Templates:**
   - **Objective:** Provide a structured format to ensure all relevant aspects of a requirement are covered.
   - **Guideline:** Use templates to maintain consistency and completeness in requirement statements.
   - **Example:** 
     - **Template:** [Trigger] Actor Action Object [Condition]  [Information]
     - **Application:** "When the navigation system is set to on-road mode, the navigation system displays the distance to the destination until another mode is chosen."

**Examples Using the Guidelines:**

- **Short Sentences:**
  - BAD: "The Navigation systems navigates to a destination with comfortable usability."
  - GOOD: "The navigation system must allow in all modes to set the destination."

- **Active Language:**
  - BAD: "When the PIN was validated, money can be withdrawn from the account."
  - GOOD: "When the ATM has validated the PIN, the customer can withdraw money from their account."

- **Avoid Weak Words:**
  - BAD: "The application should be user-friendly and quick."
  - GOOD: "The application must allow users to complete their tasks within 2 minutes without requiring training."

- **Maintain a Glossary:**
  - BAD: "The system should ensure data integrity."
  - GOOD: "The system should ensure data integrity by using checksums to verify data accuracy during transmission and storage."

- **Use Sentence Templates:**
  - **Template:** [Trigger] Actor Action Object [Condition]  [Information].
  - **Example:** "When the user selects 'Print,' the printer prints the document [Condition: if the printer is online] [Information: within 30 seconds]."

By following these guidelines, requirements will be more precise, understandable, and actionable, reducing the risk of misinterpretation and ensuring that the developed system meets the stakeholders' needs effectively.
