> [!abstract] Definition
> Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a fundamental approach in software engineering focused on designing software systems using objects. Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behaviors, interacting with one another to form a complete system. Each object maintains its own state and has operations to modify that state, contributing to the overall functionality of the software. 

Ian Sommerville, a prominent author in software engineering, describes an object-oriented system as one "made up of interacting objects that maintain their own local state and provide operations on that state information." This encapsulation of state and behavior within objects allows for modular, maintainable, and reusable code.
## No Clear Separation Between Design and Coding Principles
In object-oriented development, the principles of design and coding often intertwine. Good design principles directly influence how code is written, structured, and maintained. The seamless integration of design and coding principles ensures that the system is built with maintainability, scalability, and robustness in mind.
## Principles of Good OO Design
### [[SOLID Principle]]
- These 5 principles, often referred to as the SOLID principles, were popularized by Robert C. Martin and are intended to promote better software design and maintainability
### [[Law of Demeter]] 
### [[Boy Scout Rule]]
### [[Principle of Least Surprise]]
### [[Coding Conventions]] 
### [[Don’t repeat yourself (DRY)]] 
### [[Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)]] 
### [[You ain’t gonna need it (YAGNI)]] 
### [[Single Level of Abstraction]]
