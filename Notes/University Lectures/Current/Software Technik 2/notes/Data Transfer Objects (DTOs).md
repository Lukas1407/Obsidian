- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** are simple objects that carry data between processes or across different layers of an application, such as from the persistence layer to the presentation layer or across network boundaries in a distributed system.

**Characteristics and Usage:**

- **Data-Only Structure**: DTOs typically contain only data attributes without any business logic. They often have simple getters and setters for these attributes.
- **Reduces Method Calls**: The primary purpose of using DTOs is to reduce the number of method calls, especially in a remote interface. By aggregating the data that would be acquired through multiple calls into one object, DTOs minimize the costly overhead associated with remote calls.
- **Serialization**: In distributed systems, DTOs may include serialization methods, which allow them to be easily transmitted across a network. Serialization involves converting the object into a format that can be easily sent over the network or stored in a persistent storage, and then reconstructed back into an object later.
- **Decoupling**: They help in decoupling the domain model from client systems. Because domain objects often have complex dependencies and may include business rules and behaviors, transferring them directly over the network can be impractical and insecure. DTOs provide a way to selectively share data without exposing the domain model.

## **DTOs in Layered Architecture:**
- **Interface Between Layers**: In a layered architecture, DTOs commonly act as the data carriers between layers. For example, data fetched from the database in the persistence layer is converted into DTOs and passed to the business layer, and then from the business layer to the presentation layer as needed.
- **DTOs vs Domain Objects**: It's crucial to differentiate between DTOs and domain objects. DTOs should not contain any business logic, which is solely the responsibility of the domain objects in the domain layer. DTOs are just mechanisms for data transfer, optimized for simplicity and serialization capabilities.
