The **Waterfall Model** is one of the earliest and most straightforward process models. It is a linear sequential model where each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin, and there is typically no going back to a previous phase.

**Key Characteristics of the Waterfall Model include:**
- **Sequential Phases**: Phases like planning, requirements definition, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance follow one after the other.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Although traditionally seen as rigid, modern interpretations of the Waterfall model incorporate feedback loops that allow for limited revisions based on insights gained in later stages.
- **Documentation**: Emphasizes producing and validating extensive documentation at each phase to ensure clarity and alignment.

## Critique and Practical Challenges
The Waterfall model has been criticized for its rigidity and the difficulty it presents in accommodating changes after the project has commenced. This is particularly challenging in long-term projects where requirements may evolve based on changing technologies, market demands, or other external factors.
**Example with Airbus:**
- **Scale of Project**: The Airbus cabin software project, with its vast scale (approx. 800,000 lines of code and 4,500 person-months over 60 months), illustrates the challenges in long-term planning and risk management.
- **Timeframe Reflections**: Reflecting on different timeframes (5 days to 5 years), the text prompts consideration of what can be realistically planned and achieved in those periods, highlighting the unpredictability and the need for flexibility in project management.
**Waterfall Model in Large Projects**:
- For large projects like the Airbus example, where development spans several years, rigid adherence to a sequential approach without flexibility for feedback and iteration can lead to inefficiencies and misalignment with end-user needs by the time of completion.
