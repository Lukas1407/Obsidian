Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container that can run on any system. This container includes not only the application and its runtime environment, but also the necessary system tools and libraries.

- **Container**: A standardized unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- **Directly Run on Host OS**: Unlike virtual machines that require a guest operating system, containers share the host systemâ€™s kernel but can be isolated in terms of running processes, file systems, and network.
- **Container Engine**: The runtime environment that builds, runs, and manages containers. Popular examples include Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes for orchestration.
