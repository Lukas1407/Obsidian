These are practical rules of thumb that aid in determining the scope of a use case by evaluating its significance in everyday tasks:
1. **The Boss Test (Larman)**
   - This test involves imagining how your boss would react if you explained what you did all day. Activities that seem trivial or too granular, like "logging in" or "searching customer data," might not constitute a standalone use case that adds significant value.
2. **The Coffee Break Test (Cockburn)**
   - This heuristic suggests that a use case should end at a point where one would naturally take a break. For instance, after completing a significant task like editing and saving customer data, not merely after searching for it.
3. **The Size Test (Larman)**
   - This test checks the size of the task involved. A valid use case usually encompasses more than just a single step or minor task.
