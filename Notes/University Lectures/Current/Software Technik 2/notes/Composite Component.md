A **Composite Component** is a modular entity in software architecture composed of multiple smaller components. These can be either basic components (simple, indivisible units of functionality) or other composite components, allowing for hierarchical and complex software structures. The assembly of these components enables developers to build robust and scalable systems by reusing existing components and combining them to fulfill more complex functions.
