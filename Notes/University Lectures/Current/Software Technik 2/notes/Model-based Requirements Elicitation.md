The concept of **Model-based Requirements Elicitation** involves describing the requirements of a software system using various models, enhancing clarity and understanding through visual and textual representations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how this approach is structured and its benefits:
### Components of Model-based Requirements Elicitation
1. **[[Use Cases in Software Development|Use Case]] Texts**:
   - **Primary Tool**: Initially, requirements are often captured in text form. Use case texts are narrative descriptions of how users (or other systems) interact with the system to achieve specific goals.
   - **Flexibility**: Although primarily used to describe software interactions, use case texts can describe any sequential activity, such as the steps in a recipe, illustrating their versatility.
2. **Use Case Diagram**:
   - **Visual Aid**: Accompanies use case texts, providing a diagrammatic representation of the interactions described. This helps stakeholders visualize the relationships and flows between various parts of the system.
   - **Simplification**: Diagrams are typically used for illustration purposes to complement the detailed narratives provided in use case texts.
3. **Activity Diagrams/Petri Nets** (optional):
   - These are more detailed diagrams that can be used to model complex workflows and processes within the system, providing a deeper insight into the dynamics of system operations.
