## Lehman's First Law
- "A system that is used will be changed"
- This law implies that successful software, which continues to be in use, will inevitably require changes. If the code is not clean or well-structured, making these changes can become increasingly difficult and error-prone.
## Lehman's Second Law
- "An evolving system increases its complexity unless work is done to reduce it"
- Over time, as new features and modifications are added, a software system naturally tends to become more complex. This complexity can make the system harder to understand and maintain. Clean code practices, such as refactoring, are crucial to managing this complexity and keeping the system maintainable.
