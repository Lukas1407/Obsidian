### **Role and Functionality:**

- **Core of Business Logic**: The domain layer, or business logic layer, is central to any application. It contains the domain model which is inspired by real-life entities relevant to the specific business problem the application is solving.
- **Object Design and OOP**: This layer is where object-oriented design is heavily utilized. It involves defining classes that represent entities in the domain model with their associated attributes, behaviors, and relationships. Object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques are used to encapsulate data and behavior together in these domain objects.

### **Characteristics:**

- **Application Specific**: The domain layer is typically very specific to the application. It is designed to reflect the real-world business scenario that the application addresses.
- **Isolation of Domain Objects**: Ideally, domain objects should reside only within the domain layer to maintain separation of concerns. They encapsulate business logic, state, and behavior that should not be directly exposed to other layers, such as the presentation or persistence layers.
