> **Agile architecture** is a concept that integrates the flexibility and iterative nature of Agile methodologies with the structured planning and foresight required in architecture. 

- **Model to Understand**: The primary goal of architectural modeling in an Agile environment is not just to produce documentation or artifacts, but rather to foster a common understanding among all team members about the system's design. This approach emphasizes that the main purpose of modeling is to ensure everyone involved understands how the system is intended to function and is built.

- **Common Vision**: Developing a shared vision through modeling helps ensure that all team members are on the same page, reducing miscommunications and ensuring that the system develops cohesively over iterations.

- **Agile and Modeling**: There is a misconception that Agile methodologies do not require any architectural planning due to their adaptive nature. However, even Agile teams (like those using Scrum or XP) benefit significantly from spending some time modeling the architecture. This can involve simple sketches or diagrams that serve as a metaphor to guide development efforts.

- **Purpose in Agile**: In Agile, architecture serves to guide development without overly constraining it. It provides a framework within which teams can make informed decisions quickly as requirements evolve.
