The descriptions provided are analogies to certain dysfunctional interpersonal dynamics often observed in psychological contexts, but here they're applied to scenarios typically encountered in software reviews and team interactions. These patterns highlight how unproductive behaviors can manifest in team settings, especially during collaborative activities like code reviews. 
1. **The Alcoholic Pattern**:
   - **Roles**: Addicted, Helper, Punisher, Ashamed.
   - In a review context, this might manifest as a team member consistently showing up unprepared or late ("Addicted"), while others might enable the behavior ("Helper"), criticize it ("Punisher"), or feel embarrassed by it ("Ashamed").
   - This pattern can lead to a cycle where negative behaviors are perpetuated rather than addressed constructively.

2. **The "Now-I-Have-Got-You" Pattern**:
   - **Roles**: A discovers B's fault and uses it to exert control.
   - This could occur during reviews when one person finds a mistake and instead of helping to correct it, uses the mistake as leverage over the other, which may create a hostile environment.

3. **The "See-What-You-Made-Me-Do" Pattern**:
   - **Roles**: A does a task, B interferes, leading to an error by A, who then blames B.
   - This pattern might be seen when one team member's interruptions or modifications lead to errors, which the original person then uses to shift blame for poor outcomes.

4. **The "If-It-Were-Not-For-You" Pattern**:
   - **Roles**: A blames B for not achieving a greater success.
   - Here, a team member might blame others for not reaching a higher level of achievement, using hypothetical scenarios to deflect responsibility.

5. **The "Look-How-Hard-I-Tried" Pattern**:
   - **Roles**: A works on a failing project and overemphasizes their effort to avoid blame.
   - This pattern involves a team member highlighting their effort to preemptively absolve themselves of responsibility in case of project failure.

6. **The "Yes-But" Pattern**:
   - **Roles**: A proposes an improvement, B consistently responds with "yes, but" to dismiss suggestions.
   - This reflects a defensive stance where one member continuously rejects improvements or feedback, possibly to protect their own ideas or avoid admitting flaws.

7. **The "Wouldn't-It-Be-Nice-If" Pattern**:
   - **Roles**: A presents a solution, B suggests enhancements to boost their own reputation.
   - This can lead to unnecessary complications or feature creep as one member pushes for additions that may not be practical but serve to enhance their own status.
