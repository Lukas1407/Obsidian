> [!abstract] Definition
> The concept of microservices is a distinctive and influential architectural style in modern software development. It emphasizes creating a single application as a suite of small, independently deployable services, each running in its own process. 

### Microservices Architecture
1. **Small, Focused Services**:
    - Each service in a microservice architecture is small, focused on doing one thing well, and represents a specific business capability.
2. **Independent Deployment**:
    
    - Microservices are designed to be independently deployable. This means that each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled without affecting other services in the application. This independence greatly enhances the agility of the development process, allowing for quicker iterations and deployments.
3. **Independent Scalability**:
    
    - Each microservice can be scaled independently based on its specific load or demand. For example, a user authentication service may require more resources during peak times compared to a service that processes background tasks.
4. **Diverse Technology Stack**:
    
    - Microservices can be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies. This allows teams to choose the best tools and technologies suited for their specific service’s requirements.
5. **Decentralized Data Management**:
    
    - Each microservice manages its own database, either different instances or entirely different types of databases. This decentralized approach to data management helps avoid the database integration bottlenecks typical in monolithic architectures.
6. **Lightweight Communication**:
    
    - Microservices typically communicate with each other using lightweight, stateless communication mechanisms such as HTTP/REST APIs. This simplifies the interaction between services but also requires careful design to handle partial failures and ensure data consistency.
7. **Team Autonomy**:
    
    - Microservices allow different teams to manage different services. Each team is responsible for the full lifecycle of their service—from development and testing to deployment and operations—encouraging a more decentralized approach to app development and management.

### Microservices vs. Monolith

- **Monolithic Architecture**: A traditional monolithic application puts all its functionality into a single process and scales by replicating the monolith on multiple servers. This can be simpler to develop and deploy initially but becomes increasingly complex to scale and maintain as the application grows and updates become more frequent.
    
- **Microservices Architecture**: In contrast, microservices distribute functionality across several smaller, independent services that communicate over a network. This approach offers greater flexibility and resilience but requires more sophisticated coordination and infrastructure management.
    

### Goal and Considerations

- **Goal**: The primary goal of adopting microservices is to decouple services to achieve independent development and deployment, which enhances agility and scalability.
    
- **Consideration**: While microservices offer significant advantages in flexibility and scalability, they are not always the best approach for every situation. The complexity of managing many independent services and the overhead of handling interservice communication can be challenging.

### Characteristics of a Microservice Architecture

1. **Componentization via Services**:
    
    - Microservices are organized as independently deployable services, each representing a specific piece of functionality. Unlike traditional monolithic components, which often include a mixture of user interface, business logic, and data access code, microservices focus solely on specific business capabilities.
2. **Organized Around Business Capabilities**:
    
    - Each microservice is centered around a single business capability, aligning services closely with specific business functions. This organization allows teams to understand better and respond to business needs quickly.
3. **Products Not Projects**:
    
    - Microservice architectures promote the view of software as a product rather than a project. This shift encourages ongoing development and support, focusing on continuous improvement rather than viewing software development as having a definitive start and end.
4. **Smart Endpoints and Dumb Pipes**:
    
    - Communication between services in a microservice architecture typically follows the principle of "smart endpoints and dumb pipes." This means the services handle the business logic and data transformations, while the communication mechanisms (pipes) remain as simple and as dumb as possible (e.g., HTTP, AMQP).
5. **Decentralized Governance**:
    
    - Rather than a strict, centralized governance model, microservice architectures enable individual teams to make decisions regarding the technology and design choices for their services. This flexibility enhances agility but requires strong coordination and communication standards.
6. **Decentralized Data Management**:
    
    - Each microservice manages its own database, allowing it to control its data schema and management independently of other services. This approach helps avoid data integration and consistency issues common in monolithic architectures but can introduce complexity in maintaining data integrity across services.
7. **Infrastructure Automation**:
    
    - Microservice architectures rely heavily on automated environments for testing, deployment, and scaling. Tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are integral to managing the lifecycle of microservices efficiently.
8. **Design for Failure**:
    
    - Given that microservices operate as a distributed system, designing for failure is crucial. This includes implementing strategies such as circuit breakers, fallbacks, and retries to handle failures gracefully and maintain service availability.
9. **Evolutionary Design**:
    
    - Microservice architectures are built with change in mind, allowing for continuous evolution of services as business needs change. This approach supports iterative updates and improvements without the need for large-scale redesigns.

### Componentization via Services

- **Services as Deployable Components**:
    
    - In microservice architectures, services are treated as deployable components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This independence is crucial for enabling the rapid iteration and robustness of the architecture.
- **Explicit Component Interfaces**:
    
    - Services define their interactions through explicit interfaces using mechanisms like RESTful APIs or messaging protocols. This explicitness ensures that services can interact seamlessly despite being developed by different teams using potentially different technologies.
- **Consequences of Using Components**:
    
    - The modular nature of microservices allows for high flexibility in deployment and scalability. Changes to one service generally do not impact others, reducing the risk associated with deployments and enabling faster innovation cycles.

### Organized Around Business Capabilities

The concept of organizing services around business capabilities in a microservice architecture directly aligns with **Conway's Law**, which posits that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures. In the context of microservices, this principle supports the idea that each microservice should represent a discrete business capability that reflects how the organization operates and communicates internally.

#### Key Points:

1. **Service Division**: Microservices are divided according to business functionality, with each service handling a distinct segment of the business. For example, an e-commerce application might have separate microservices for user management, product management, order processing, and payment processing.
    
2. **Autonomy and Isolation**: By focusing on specific business capabilities, each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently from others. This isolation minimizes dependencies and simplifies understanding each service's role within the larger system.
    
3. **Reflecting Organizational Structure**: According to Conway's Law, the architecture of the system (in this case, microservices) will reflect the organizational structure. This means that if a company is organized into departments that handle different aspects of the business, the microservices architecture will likely mimic this structure with services dedicated to each department's functions.
    

### Products not Projects

The shift from viewing software as a series of projects to treating it as a product is fundamental in microservice architecture. This approach changes how software is conceived, developed, and maintained over its lifecycle.

#### Key Points:

1. **Continuous Development**: Unlike projects that have a definite beginning and end, products are continually improved based on user feedback and business needs. This continuous development cycle is well-suited to microservices, where each service can evolve independently to better serve its business function.
    
2. **Personal Relationships**: The granular nature of microservices facilitates closer relationships between service developers and their end-users. This closeness allows for more immediate feedback and a deeper understanding of the user’s needs, which in turn can lead to more effective and user-centric service enhancements.
    
3. **Responsibility of Teams**: In many microservice environments, the teams responsible for developing services are also responsible for deploying, managing, and troubleshooting them — a practice known as DevOps. This integration of development and operations encourages greater ownership and accountability, leading to higher quality services and more stable deployments.

### Smart Endpoints and Dumb Pipes

#### Concept

This design principle suggests that in a microservices architecture, the complexity should be placed into the services themselves (the "endpoints"), while the communication between services (the "pipes") should be as simple and dumb as possible.

#### Characteristics

1. **Decoupling and Cohesion**: Each microservice is highly decoupled from others, focusing solely on fulfilling its specific business capability. This decoupling allows services to evolve independently of one another.
2. **Domain Logic Ownership**: Microservices own their domain logic and process data independently. They act like small, self-contained applications that handle everything from data receiving to processing and responding.
3. **Unix-like Filtering**: Microservices work similarly to Unix filters by receiving requests, processing them through internal logic, and producing responses. This streamlined process enhances clarity and efficiency.
4. **Simple Communication**: Communication between services is facilitated through simple, stateless mechanisms such as HTTP and REST. This simplicity ensures that the services remain loosely coupled and the architecture scalable.

### Decentralized Governance

#### Concept

Decentralized governance in microservices architecture allows individual teams to make decisions regarding the technology and practices best suited to their specific services. This independence encourages innovation and agility within teams.

#### Characteristics

1. **Tool Production**: Microservices teams often develop tools that can be reused by others within the organization. This approach leverages practical solutions that have proven effective in real-world applications.
2. **Shared Libraries and Tools**: Tools and libraries developed by one team are shared across the organization, promoting a culture of collaboration and reuse. This practice helps in maintaining consistency while allowing flexibility where needed.
3. **Evolving Service Contracts**: Microservices adopt patterns like the Tolerant Reader and Consumer-Driven Contracts to manage changes in service interfaces without breaking functionality. These patterns allow services to evolve their APIs independently while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Applied Patterns

- **Tolerant Reader**: Services are designed to handle changes in the data they consume without breaking. This pattern allows services to ignore additional fields and manage missing data gracefully, which is crucial in a dynamic environment where service contracts can change frequently.
- **Consumer-Driven Contracts**: This pattern allows the consumers of a service to contribute to the service’s contract tests, ensuring that the service meets the consumers' needs and expectations. It fosters a development environment where upstream and downstream services can evolve without fear of breaking existing integrations.
