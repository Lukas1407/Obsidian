- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a technique that implements DIP by providing objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them internally. Essentially, it's about removing the responsibility of instantiating dependencies from the class and having a third party (an IoC container or a factory) handle the creation and delivery of these dependencies.
**Benefits**:
- **Simplifies Testing**: By injecting dependencies, it becomes easy to replace real dependencies with mocks or stubs during testing, simplifying unit testing of classes in isolation.
- **Decouples Boilerplate Code**: Reduces the coupling in the setup code (boilerplate code) needed to construct complex object graphs by offloading that responsibility to the IoC container or a factory.
**Drawbacks**:
- **Complex Configuration**: Dependency injection can lead to complex configuration management where managing and tracing the flow of dependencies can become difficult, especially in large projects.
