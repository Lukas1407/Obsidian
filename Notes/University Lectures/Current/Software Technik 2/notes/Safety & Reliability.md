### Safety
- **Definition**: Safety refers to the absence of danger to humans and the environment. It emphasizes the prevention of catastrophic failures that could result in injury or environmental damage.
- **Fail-safe State**: A crucial aspect of safety is the system's ability to enter a fail-safe state. In this state, even if the system fails, it does not pose a danger to the environment or human life. For example, in many electrical systems, a fail-safe state may involve cutting off power to prevent overheating or fire.

### Reliability
- **Definition**: Reliability concerns the probability or duration of failure-free operation. It is a measure of how consistently a system performs its intended function without failure.
- **Relation to Safety**: While a reliable system is desirable, a highly reliable system does not necessarily mean it is safe. A system can fail reliably (i.e., predictably) without causing safety issues, especially if these failures do not lead to dangerous outcomes.


### Importance in Design
- **Safety and Reliability in Design**: For safety-critical systems (like medical devices, automotive systems), ensuring high reliability can often enhance safety because the likelihood of faults leading to unsafe conditions is reduced. However, designing systems to enter a fail-safe state upon detecting faults is crucial to prevent catastrophic outcomes.
