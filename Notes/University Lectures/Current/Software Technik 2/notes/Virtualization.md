Virtualization technology allows for the creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as operating systems, servers, storage devices, and network resources.

- **General Definition**: It's the process of creating a software-based, or virtual, representation of something, which separates computational functions from the physical hardware layer.
- **Virtual Machines and Hypervisors**:
    - **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: These are the digital versions of physical computers. They run an operating system and applications as if they were on a physical machine but are hosted on a server.
    - **Hypervisor**: Also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), it is software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. It manages the execution of the VMs and makes it possible to run multiple VMs on a single physical machine.
    - **Abstract View**: Users interact with virtual resources as if they were physical, but without needing to manage the complexities associated with physical hardware.
    - **Isolation**: Each VM is isolated from others, which means that processes in one VM do not affect others. This isolation helps in maintaining stability and security across the system.
### Benefits of Virtualization
- **Efficiency**: Increases IT agility, flexibility, and scalability while creating significant cost savings. Greater workload mobility, increased performance, and availability of resources.
- **Speed and Agility**: Provides faster provisioning of applications and resources.
- **Economy of Scale**: Achieves more with fewer resources. Because virtual environments are software-defined, they can be managed and automated very efficiently using software tools.
- **Consolidation and Energy Efficiency**: By consolidating multiple virtual machines (VMs) onto fewer physical servers, organizations can reduce energy consumption and hardware costs.
- **Availability**: VMs can be migrated between physical servers without service interruption, which enhances fault tolerance and reduces downtime.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Virtual environments can support service level agreements by ensuring resources are allocated in accordance with business priorities.
- **Resource Efficiency (Overbooking/Thin Provisioning)**: Resources like CPU and memory can be overbooked to maximize utilization since all VMs do not peak at the same time.
- **Decoupling of Demand and Resource Provisioning**: Allows businesses to scale resources up or down based on demand without the need for immediate physical hardware adjustments.
- **De-duplication of Storage**: Techniques like storage de-duplication where identical data is stored only once help in reducing the amount of storage needed.
- **Automated Management**: Virtual environments can be managed more effectively with automation tools, leading to more streamlined operations.
- **Support for Multicore and Hardware Virtualization Technologies**: Modern CPUs support hardware virtualization enhancements (e.g., Intel VT-x and AMD-V) that improve the efficiency and performance of virtual machines.
