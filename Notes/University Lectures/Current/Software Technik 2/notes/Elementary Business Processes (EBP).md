This concept helps in defining the granularity of a use case. An EBP is:
  - A task performed by one person, in one place, at one time.
  - Triggered in response to a specific business event.
  - Adds measurable business value and leaves the system data in a consistent state.
- **Examples**: Approving a credit request, processing a payment, or updating customer records.
