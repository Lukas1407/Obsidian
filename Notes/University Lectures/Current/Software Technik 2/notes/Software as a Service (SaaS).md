SaaS delivers software applications over the Internet, which are managed by third-party vendors.

- **What it provides**: Applications available via a web browser or program interface. These are maintained and managed by the service provider.
- **Consumer control**: Users generally do not manage or control any of the underlying infrastructure but can configure software settings and use the software.
- **Consumer does not manage**: The network, servers, operating systems, storage, and often, the specific application settings beyond limited user-specific settings.
- **Examples**: Salesforce.com, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Microsoft Office 365.

### Key Characteristics of SaaS
**Software as a Service (SaaS)**, in contrast, shifts many of these responsibilities and costs from the customer to the service provider. Key characteristics include:
- **Network-based Access**: Users access SaaS applications over the internet, reducing the need for internal hardware and associated maintenance.
- **Central Management**: SaaS providers manage the software centrally, eliminating the need for customers to handle software updates, patch management, and system monitoring locally.
- **One-to-Many Model**: SaaS typically operates on a multi-tenant architecture, where a single instance of the software serves multiple customers. This scalability helps in spreading out the cost and resources efficiently.
- **Centralized Updating**: The provider manages updates and upgrades, deploying them centrally to all users, which negates the need for end-users to download or install patches.
- **Reduced Direct Costs**: Many of the costs associated with traditional software deployments (like installation, maintenance, and backups) are handled by the provider, potentially lowering the TCO for users.
### Comparison and Considerations
- **License-based software delivery** often involves higher initial costs and continuous investment in hardware, human resources, and maintenance. It might be suitable for organizations needing highly customized solutions where control over the software environment is critical.
- **SaaS**, on the other hand, offers a lower initial investment and is generally easier to scale. It is ideal for businesses looking for standard applications without the need for significant customization.
