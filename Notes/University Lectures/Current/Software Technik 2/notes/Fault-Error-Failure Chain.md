### Fault-Error-Failure Chain
This concept explains the progression from a fault in a system to a potential failure:
- **Fault**: A defect within the system, potentially dormant, that does not affect system operations under certain conditions. These are often bugs that may not activate under normal conditions.
- **Error**: An error occurs when a fault is activated and the system behaves unexpectedly within its boundary. This discrepancy between intended and actual behavior is usually detected during runtime.
- **Failure**: A failure is an event where the system no longer meets its specified performance criteria, visibly deviating from expected behavior or specifications. 

### Types of Faults
Understanding the different types of faults helps in designing better fault tolerance and safety mechanisms:
- **Systematic Faults**: These faults arise from errors in design or during the build process, often repeating under similar conditions unless the design is corrected.
- **Random Faults**: These occur unexpectedly and are not due to design issues. They can be due to external factors or internal component failures.
  - **Transient Faults**: Temporary and often disappear after some time or after restarting the system. These can often be managed by retries.
  - **Persistent Faults**: These faults remain until there is a direct intervention to correct or replace the faulty component.
### Importance in Design
- **Handling Faults**: Incorporating strategies to detect and manage faults, such as through redundancy (having backup components) or robust fault-handling routines, is essential in maintaining both the safety and reliability of a system.
