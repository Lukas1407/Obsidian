- These systems are designed to continuously monitor environmental parameters (like temperature in this case) and adjust controls automatically to maintain desired set points.
- The real-time nature ensures that responses to changes in the monitored variables are immediate and precise, which is critical in environments where delays can lead to inefficiency or damage, such as in industrial settings or residential heating systems.
## Example

- **Periodic Stimulus (500 Hz)**:
    - The system receives data inputs at a frequency of 500 Hz. This means it is capable of handling 500 readings per second from various sensors.
    - This high frequency ensures that the system can react almost instantaneously to changes in the environment.
- **Sensor Process**:
    - This process involves reading and initially processing data from temperature sensors. This is a crucial step where raw sensor data is converted into a more usable form for decision-making processes.
- **Thermostat Process**:
    - This process interprets the sensor values to determine whether the heating needs to be adjusted. It acts as a decision-maker based on the inputs received from the sensors.
- **Heater Control Process**:
    - Based on the decisions made by the thermostat process, this control system executes the commands to turn the heaters on or off. This is an example of a control system interacting with hardware actuators.
- **Furnace Control Process**:
    - An additional layer that might be responsible for more granular or higher-capacity heating control.
- **Data Flow**:
    - The arrows indicate the flow of information between processes, which is essential for the integrated function of the system. The flow ensures that each process receives the necessary data to perform its function correctly.
- **Aperiodic Stimulus**:
    - The system might also handle non-periodic events, such as emergency shut-offs or system overrides, which do not occur at regular intervals.
