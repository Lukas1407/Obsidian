In a **single-tenant architecture**, each customer (tenant) has their own independent database and instance of the software application. No two tenants share these resources. This setup is akin to each tenant having their own dedicated set of hardware and software that is not used by any other tenants, as shown in the provided diagram where each customer has their own hardware and operating system.

**Advantages:**

- **Security**: Since there is no sharing of resources, this architecture provides strong security isolation.
- **Customization**: Easier to customize applications to specific tenant needs because each environment is separate.
- **Control and Privacy**: Each tenant has greater control over their environment and better privacy since their applications and data are isolated from others.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Cost**: More expensive than multi-tenant solutions because it requires more resources and management overhead.
- **Inefficiency**: Underutilization of resources can occur since each tenant's hardware may not be fully utilized.
- **Scalability**: Scaling requires duplicating the entire setup for each new customer, which can be slower and more complex.
