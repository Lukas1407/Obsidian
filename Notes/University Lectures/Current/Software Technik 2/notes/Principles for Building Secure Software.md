- **Secure the Weakest Link**: Focus security efforts on the most vulnerable parts of the system, whether they be software, hardware, or human factors.
    
- **Practice Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security so that if one fails, another will hopefully stop the threat.
    
- **Fail Securely**: Design systems to handle failures in a secure manner, ensuring that failures do not expose the system to further risk.
    
- **Secure by Default**: Configure software to be secure from the start, with all necessary security measures enabled by default.
    
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users the minimum access necessary for their tasks, reducing the potential impact of a security breach.
    
- **No Security Through Obscurity**: Avoid relying on secrecy (like hidden URLs or logins) for security, as these can often be discovered through reverse engineering.
    
- **Minimize Attack Surface**: Reduce the amount of code and the number of interfaces, which can decrease potential vulnerabilities.
    
- **Privileged Core**: Isolate code that requires security privileges, allowing more focus on securing these critical parts.
    
- **Input Validation and Output Encoding**: Always validate incoming data to ensure it meets expectations and encode outputs to prevent execution of unwanted scripts.
    
- **Donâ€™t Mix Data and Code**: Keep data external from executable code to prevent issues like buffer overflows, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
