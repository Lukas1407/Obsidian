- These are specialized real-time systems that focus on collecting and processing data from various sensors. The emphasis is often on handling large volumes of data efficiently.
- An example provided is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which generates massive amounts of data that require real-time processing to be meaningful for scientific research.
