> [!abstract] Definition
> **SEFF** is a method used to model and predict the behavior and performance of software components based on their interaction with other components. It abstracts the internal behavior of components and focuses on the externally visible actions of a component's provided services. 

### Key Concepts and Components

1. **Component Developer Role**:
   - The component developer is responsible for defining SEFF models that describe how components behave in response to external interactions.
   - They ensure that components are designed to be reusable in various contexts, potentially unknown at the time of development.

2. **Performance Specification**:
   - SEFF provides a detailed description of component performance, considering different operational conditions and interactions.
   - It quantifies the resource usage (like CPU time), service response times, and throughputs for different component services.

3. **Composability and Reusability**:
   - Components are designed to be easily composable with other components, maintaining flexibility and adaptability across different systems and architectures.
   - Reusability is emphasized to allow components to function effectively in diverse environments and scenarios, enhancing the efficiency of software development processes.

4. **Parameterization**:
   - SEFF models can be parameterized with variables that influence component behavior, such as input sizes, iteration counts, or resource availability.
   - This feature allows the component behavior to be adjusted or predicted under varying operational parameters, making the models adaptable and scalable.

### Diagram Explanation

- **First Diagram**:
  - Shows SEFF being used to specify the interactions between a component (e.g., Component A) and other components (Component B and Component C) it interacts with.
  - Arrows indicate the flow of services such as `a()`, `b()`, `c()`, and `d()`, representing the services provided and required by the components.

- **Second Diagram**:
  - This diagram illustrates a detailed SEFF model with timing information (e.g., `28ms`, `20ms`, `5ms`) for various services.
  - It includes a loop and conditional behaviors, demonstrating how SEFF can model dynamic and conditional operations within a component, affecting performance metrics like execution time and resource usage.

### The Role of SEFF in Component-Based Development
- **Performance Prediction**: SEFF allows developers to predict how changes in component design or deployment context will affect system performance. This predictive capability is crucial for designing systems that meet performance requirements without extensive trial and error.
- **Design Optimization**: By understanding the performance implications of different design choices through SEFF, developers can optimize components for better efficiency and effectiveness in various operational scenarios.
- **Conflict Resolution**: The inherent conflict between component performance and reusability is managed through the flexibility provided by SEFF's parameterization and abstraction. It helps in balancing the need for specific performance metrics with the broader goal of component adaptability across multiple contexts.

### Independent from External Services
![[Pasted image 20240701160911.png#invert|400]]
1. **Explicit Modeling of External Service Calls**: The diagram demonstrates how a software component (like a CPU performing a specific task) can call external services. In this case, the component makes an external call to a service defined by `IAccounting`. This illustrates the component's dependence on external interfaces, but not on their concrete implementations, which allows for flexibility and interchangeability.
2. **Binding to Interfaces Only**: The system design does not hard-wire the components to specific implementations but rather to interfaces (`IAccounting`). This means the actual service invoked could change depending on how the system is assembled, allowing the same component to be used in different contexts with different external services.
3. **Combination of SEFFs Post-Assembly**: After components are assembled, their individual SEFFs (which describe their behavior) can be combined to provide a comprehensive view of the systemâ€™s overall behavior. This is crucial for understanding system-wide performance and interactions.
### Parameterization of Usage
1. **Resource Demand and Behavior Dependence**: The behavior of components can vary significantly based on how they are used. For example, the compression of a file may depend on the file size, and the number of iterations in a loop may depend on the size of the data collection being processed.
2. **Abstraction and Parameterization**: To handle varying usage patterns effectively, components' behaviors are abstracted and parameterized with performance-relevant information such as `Array.NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS`, `file.BYTESIZE`, `request.TYPE`, etc. This parameterization allows components to adjust their behavior dynamically based on input characteristics.
3. **Propagation of Usage Information**: It's important that usage information (like file size or number of elements) is propagated through the system so that each component can adjust its behavior accordingly. This ensures that resource allocation and performance optimization are based on current operational data.
### Parameterization of Resource Environment
1. **Resource Demand Specification**:
    - **Internal Actions**: These are operations or computations performed by a component that consume system resources like CPU cycles or disk I/O operations.
    - **Abstract Units**: The resource demand of these internal actions is expressed in abstract units rather than specific time values. This abstraction allows the model to be adaptable to different hardware configurations or environments without needing to be redefined.
2. **Dependence on Resource Environment**:
    - **Environment Dependent**: The actual performance or timing values are dependent on the specific characteristics of the resource environment where the component is deployed. For example, `10 <cpu>` units might translate to different actual execution times on different processors.
3. **Derivation of Timing Values**:
    - **Post-Deployment Specification**: Timing values for how long each internal action takes are derived after the deployment environment is specified. This means that once you know the specifics of the hardware (like CPU speed, disk speed, memory availability), you can calculate the actual time it will take for a `10 <cpu>` demand to be processed.
4. **Role of the Deployer**:
    - **Specification by Deployer**: The resource environment, including specifics about the available hardware and its capabilities, is defined by the system deployer. This information is critical for translating the abstract resource demands into concrete performance metrics.
### Parameterization Combined
1. **Reusable in Different Contexts**: This concept is crucial for enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of software components. By designing components with parameterized SEFFs, they can be reused in different assembly contexts, allocation scenarios, and usage patterns without requiring significant redesign.
2. **Example of Combined Parameterization**: In the provided scenario, the component `ICompress` provides a `compressImage` service, which is parameterized by image quality and type. The system decides which compression algorithm to use based on the quality parameter. This decision affects resource demand (CPU usage), which is calculated based on the image type and quality.
3. **Dynamic Decision-Making in SEFFs**: The branching actions (`ChooseAlgorithm` based on `quality.VALUE`) and resource demand calculations (`10 * img.BYTESIZE`) are examples of how parameterization allows components to adapt their behavior based on dynamic input values and conditions.
