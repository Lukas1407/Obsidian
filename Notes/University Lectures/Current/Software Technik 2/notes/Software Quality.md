## Dimensions of Software Quality
![[Pasted image 20240707142018.png#invert|800]]
### 1. **Functionality**
- **Suitability**: The appropriateness of the software for specific tasks.
- **Accuracy**: The provision of correct results or effects.
- **Interoperability**: The ability to interact with one or more specified systems.
- **Security**: Protecting information and data so that unauthorised access or modifications are prevented.
- **Functionality Compliance**: Adherence to standards, conventions, or regulations in laws and similar prescriptions.
### 2. **Reliability**
- **Maturity**: Frequency of failure by faults in the software.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system's ability to operate under a predefined level of faults.
- **Recoverability**: The capability to re-establish a specified level of performance and recover the data directly affected in case of failure.
### 3. **Usability**
- **Understandability**: Ease of understanding how the software can be used.
- **Learnability**: Ease of learning the application's capabilities.
- **Operability**: The user control and convenience of use offered by the software.
- **Attractiveness**: The attractiveness of the user interface and user interaction.
- **Usability Compliance**: The degree to which the software adheres to standards or conventions relating to usability.
### 4. **Efficiency**
- **Time Behaviour**: The response and processing times and throughput rates of the software.
- **Resource Utilisation**: The amounts and types of resources used by the software.
- **Efficiency Compliance**: The software's compliance with standards regarding efficiency.
### 5. **Maintainability**
- **Analysability**: Ease of diagnosing deficiencies or causes of failures, or identifying parts to be modified.
- **Changeability**: The ease with which a product can be modified to correct defects, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment.
- **Stability**: The risk of unexpected effects from modifications in the software.
- **Testability**: The ease with which test criteria can be established for the software and tests can be performed.
### 6. **Portability**
- **Adaptability**: The ability of the software to be adapted for different specified environments without applying other actions or means than those provided for this purpose.
- **Installability**: Ease with which the software can be installed in a specified environment.
- **Co-existence**: The ability of the software to co-exist with other independent software in a common environment sharing common resources.
- **Replaceability**: The ability to use the software in place of another specified software in the environment of that software.
## Quality Metrics
The quality metrics you've listed (Performance, Reliability, Security) tie into these dependability dimensions:
- **Performance Metrics** such as Response Time and Throughput measure how quickly a system responds to requests and the volume of transactions it can handle, impacting its Availability.
- **Reliability Metrics** like Probability of Failure on Demand (POFOD) and Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) provide quantitative data on how frequently the system is likely to fail and how long it can typically operate before a failure occurs.
- **Security Metrics** like Mean Time to Security Failure (MTTSF) gauge the resilience of the system against security breaches.

### 1. **Availability**
- **Definition**: The ability of the system to deliver services when requested by the user.
- **Focus**: Ensures that the system is up and running and capable of delivering services anytime they are needed, minimizing downtime.
### 2. **Reliability**
- **Definition**: The ability of the system to deliver services as specified (or as expected) without failure.
- **Focus**: Relates to the system performing its intended function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
### 3. **Safety**
- **Definition**: The ability of the system to operate without catastrophic failure without danger to humans or the environment.
- **Focus**: Ensures the system does not cause any harm or danger to users or the environment, even when it fails.
### 4. **Security**
- **Definition**: The ability of the system to protect itself against deliberate or accidental intrusion.
- **Focus**: Protects against unauthorized access and threats, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
### 5. **Resilience**
- **Definition**: The ability of the system to resist and recover from damaging events.
- **Focus**: The capability to quickly recover from disruptions, ensuring continuity of service.
