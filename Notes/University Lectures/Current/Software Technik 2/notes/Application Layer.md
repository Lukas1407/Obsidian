#### Role and Responsibilities

- **Request Distribution**: This layer acts as a mediator that distributes incoming requests to the appropriate parts of the system.
- **Session State Management**: It keeps track of the userâ€™s session state, which is crucial in systems where user sessions persist across multiple interactions.
- **Control Flow Management**: The application layer manages the logical flow of the application, such as the order of window or web page displays and the progression of user tasks.
- **Implementation of System Operations**: Functions like processing a sale in a Point of Sale (POS) system are implemented here. This layer encapsulates the operations into manageable, reusable components.

#### Implementation Considerations

- **Session Facades**: In Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)-based systems, session facades are used to package business logic so that it can be used easily from the presentation layer without exposing complex business logic.
- **Importance in Multi-tier Architectures**: For simple applications, it might be feasible to call domain objects directly from the UI. However, in multi-tier architectures (common in enterprise environments), having a dedicated application layer is essential for managing more complex interactions and maintaining clean separation of concerns.
- **Controller/Facade per Use Case**: A practical approach is to implement one controller or facade per use case. This provides a clear pathway from user actions at the UI layer to operations in the application and domain layers.
