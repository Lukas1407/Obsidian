> Requirements engineering is a fundamental and structured phase in the software development lifecycle, focused on determining user expectations for a new or altered system. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the software development process delivers a product that meets the needs and constraints of all stakeholders involved. 

- Requirement engineering and design involves identifying major system components, their communications and mapping to hardware resources.
## Integration in Software Design
The process of requirements engineering often overlaps with system design, especially in agile environments where the design evolves along with the requirements. This integration between requirements engineering and system design is crucial for several reasons:
- **Feedback Loops**: Design decisions can influence requirements and vice versa. For example, technical constraints discovered during design may require revisiting the requirements.
- **Iterative Development**: In agile methodologies, requirements and design are developed iteratively, with constant adjustments based on stakeholder feedback and evolving project needs.
- **No Clear Distinction Between 'What' and 'How'**: In complex systems, distinguishing between what the system needs to do ('what') and how it will do it ('how') can be challenging. Design choices often need to be considered when defining requirements because they might impact feasibility, cost, or timeline.
