### The User Interface Layer

#### Responsibilities

- **Presentation of Data**: The UI layer is responsible for presenting data to users. This involves displaying information in a clear, concise, and interactive format.
- **Managing User Interaction**: This layer handles all interactions with the user, such as input from keyboards, mouse clicks, touchscreen gestures, etc. It includes managing the flow of screens (navigation) and responding to user actions.

#### Control Flow in Java and Swing

- In environments like Java with a Swing UI, once control is handed over to the Swing framework, it remains there until an action (such as a button click or form submission) triggers an `ActionEvent`.
- **Hollywood Principle**: This refers to the inversion of control, where lower-level components (UI elements) do not call higher-level application logic directly; instead, they provide hooks that higher-level components can call back into. This is summarized as "don't call us, we call you."
- **Event Handling**: UI event handlers should ideally not process system events directly due to separation of concerns. Instead, they should forward events to a more centralized handling system, typically the application facade, which then delegates tasks to the domain layer or business logic. This keeps the UI layer clean and focused solely on user interaction elements.
