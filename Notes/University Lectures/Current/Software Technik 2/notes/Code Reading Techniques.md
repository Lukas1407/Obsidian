- **Reading based on test cases**: This involves using specific test cases to guide the review of the code, focusing on how well the code meets the criteria defined by the test cases.

- **Hypothesis-based reading**: When a reviewer encounters certain structures (like loops or conditional statements), they form hypotheses about what these structures are intended to do (e.g., iterating over arrays, handling errors). The reviewer then checks these assumptions against the actual implementation.

- **Architectural Reading**: This involves identifying design patterns and architectural decisions in the code. This type of reading is less about the details and more about understanding the high-level structure and design rationale.
