- **Domain Model**:
    - Represents the stakeholders' view of the noteworthy concepts in the domain. It includes entities, their attributes, and relationships, as seen in the example of "Payment," "Pays_for," and "Sale."
    - The domain model serves as an abstraction that helps manage complexity by capturing the essential aspects of the domain.
- **Domain Layer**:
    - This layer implements the domain model in software, translating the conceptual model into practical, executable components and classes.
    - The diagram illustrates that while the domain model might conceptualize entities like "Payment" and "Sale," the domain layer implements these as software classes with attributes and methods (e.g., `Payment` class with attributes like `amount` and methods like `getBalance()`).

### Key Points Highlighted in the Image
- **Object Design in the Domain Layer**: The actual design and implementation of objects (classes) are primarily done in the domain layer, drawing inspiration directly from the domain model.
- **Reduction of Representational Gap**: The image points out that the representational gap between how stakeholders conceive the domain and its software representation is minimized. This closeness ensures that the software accurately reflects the business requirements and logic.
