- In real-time operating systems, managing the timing and order of operations is critical. Processes may be scheduled based on various factors:
  - **Real-Time Clock Ticks**: Trigger interrupts that manage the scheduling of periodic tasks.
  - **Dispatcher**: Determines which processes to execute based on their readiness and urgency. This is often influenced by the processes' deadlinesâ€”tasks with imminent deadlines are prioritized.

### Handling Concurrent Processes:
- In situations where multiple processes might be triggered simultaneously, priority is typically given to the process with the shortest deadline. This ensures that the most time-sensitive tasks are handled first, reducing the risk of missing critical deadlines.
