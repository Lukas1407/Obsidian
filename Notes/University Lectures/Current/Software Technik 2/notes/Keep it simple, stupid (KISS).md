>  The KISS principle advocates for simplicity in code. It is about avoiding unnecessary complexity and keeping the code straightforward and easy to understand.

## Details
- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: The simplest approach to solving a problem is usually the best. Avoid over-engineering solutions with unnecessary layers of abstraction or complexity.
- **Adequate Solutions**: Use the most straightforward data structures or interfaces adequate for the problem at hand. For instance, use `IEnumerable` if you only need to iterate over a collection, rather than opting for more complex structures like `ICollection` or `IList` which provide additional functionalities that may not be required.
- **Code Understandability**: Simplicity makes code easier to read and understand for any developer who might work on it, whether they are junior or senior.
### Techniques to Maintain Simplicity
- **Code Reviews**: Regularly reviewing code with peers helps catch overly complex solutions early and keeps the codebase clean and understandable.
- **Pair Programming**: Working in pairs encourages discussing ideas out loud, leading to simpler and more effective designs.
