Formerly known as Simple Object Access Protocol and now just SOAP, it is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services using XML. It operates over existing protocols like HTTP, allowing it to work easily across the web. SOAP defines a uniform way to encode an XML message that can be transmitted across different underlying protocols.
