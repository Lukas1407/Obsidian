**Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a variant of reinforcement learning that <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">models the distribution of returns, rather than only their expectation</mark>. This approach <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">provides a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of returns</mark>, which can improve learning and decision-making under uncertainty. 
### Concept of Distributional RL
**Traditional RL** typically focuses on estimating the expected return $Q(s,a)$ from state $s$ and action $a$, which represents the mean outcome. In contrast, **Distributional RL** aims to model the entire distribution of possible returns $Z(s, a)$, capturing the full range of potential outcomes and their probabilities.
### Distributional Bellman Equation
In Distributional RL, the returns are modeled as a random variable with a probability distribution. The key here is the Distributional Bellman Equation, which is an extension of the traditional Bellman equation:
$$ Z(s, a) = R(s, a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}[Z(s', a')]$$

Where:
- $R(s, a)$ is the reward received after taking action $a$ in state $s$.
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor.
- $\mathbb{E}[Z(s', a')]$ is the expected distribution of returns for the next state-action pair.
### Implementation with Atoms
1. **Discrete Distribution Representation**:
   - The distribution of returns is approximated using a discrete set of outcomes, called "atoms". Each atom represents a possible return value, spaced evenly between $V_{min}$ and $V_{max}$.
   - The gap between atoms is defined as $\Delta z = \frac{V_{max} - V_{min}}{N-1}$, where $N$ is the number of atoms.

2. **Probability of Atoms**:
   - The probability of each atom is modeled using a softmax distribution over a function of state and action, parameterized by $\theta$: 
   $$ p_i = \frac{e^{f(s, a, \theta)_i}}{\sum_j e^{f(s, a, \theta)_j}} $$
   - Each atom $z_i$ has an associated probability $p_i$, which represents how likely the return is to be around $z_i$.
### Projection and Updates
After a Bellman update, the resulting distribution $R(s, a) + \gamma Z(s', a')$ may suggest return values outside the original support of atoms or between them. Hence, we need to project this new distribution back onto the predefined set of atoms:
- **Projection** involves mapping each possible return from the update onto the nearest atoms, essentially redistributing the probability mass to ensure the entire distribution remains defined within the bounds $[V_{min}, V_{max}]$.
- **Interpolation** is used to split the probability mass of returns that fall between two atoms.
### Why Distributional RL?
1. **Advantages**:
   - **Better Risk Assessment**: Understanding the full distribution of returns allows an agent to make more informed decisions, especially in environments where risk and uncertainty are significant.
   - **Improved Learning Stability**: By learning distributions rather than expectations, the learning process can inherently capture more information about the environmentâ€™s dynamics, potentially leading to more stable and robust policies.
2. **Learning with Cross-Entropy Loss**:
   - The softmax classification of atom probabilities allows for the use of cross-entropy loss, which can be more stable and effective in learning probability distributions compared to mean squared error (MSE) that is commonly used for scalar predictions.
