>  It’s an interaction between an electron of the anode material and the striking electron

- The energy of the emitted photon is **quantized**, meaning it has a specific, fixed value $$E2 - E1 = \hbar \omega$$ that corresponds to the energy difference between the two shells involved in the transition.
- This is why it’s called “characteristic” radiation – because the energy of the emitted photons is characteristic of the anode material’s atomic structure, not dependent on the tube voltage.
## Mechanism
- When a fast-moving electron collides with an inner shell electron in the target material (such as tungsten), both electrons are ejected from the atom. This ejection leaves behind a “hole” in the inner shell.
- An outer shell electron then fills this hole, transitioning from an outer shell (e.g., L-shell, M-shell) to the inner K-shell. During this transition, the electron emits a single X-ray photon, which we call a characteristic photon.
- The energy level of this characteristic photon corresponds to the energy difference between the outer and inner shell electrons involved in the transition.
