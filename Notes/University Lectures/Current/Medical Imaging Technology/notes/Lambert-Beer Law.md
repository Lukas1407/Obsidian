> [!abstract] Definition
> The **Lambert-Beer law**, also known as the **Beer-Lambert law**, is a fundamental principle in the field of spectroscopy and radiography, including [[X-Ray Imaging]]. It describes the attenuation of electromagnetic (EM) radiation as it passes through a material. 

- As EM radiation, like X-rays, travels through a material, its intensity decreases due to absorption and scattering. This decrease in intensity is what we call attenuation.

## Equation
$$I = I_0 e^{-\mu l}$$
- $I$ is the intensity of the X-rays after passing through the material; $I_0$ is the original intensity of the X-rays. $μ$ is the [[Linear Attenuation Coefficient]] (depends on the material); $x$ thickness of the material.
- This equation tells us that <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the intensity of the radiation decreases exponentially with the thickness</mark> of the material it passes through.
