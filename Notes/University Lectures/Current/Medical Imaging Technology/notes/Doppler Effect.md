- When the source of the waves (like an ambulance siren) moves towards an observer, the waves are compressed, leading to a higher frequency or pitch.
- Conversely, when the source moves away from the observer, the waves are stretched, resulting in a lower frequency or pitch.

- The observed frequency $f$ can be calculated using the formula:$$f = \left( \frac{c \pm v_r}{c \pm v_s} \right) f_0 $$where,
	- $f_0$ is the actual frequency emitted by the source.
	- $c$ is the speed of the wave in the medium (for sound, this is the speed of sound in air).
	- $v_r$ is the speed of the receiver relative to the medium.
	- $v_s$ is the speed of the source relative to the medium.
- The plus and minus signs in the formula account for the direction of movement.
	- If the receiver (observer) is moving towards the source, $v_r$ is added to $c$ in the numerator.
	- If the receiver is moving away from the source, $v_r$ is subtracted from $c$.
	- If the source is moving away from the receiver, $v_s$ is added to $c$  in the denominator.
	- If the source is moving towards the receiver, $v_s$ is subtracted from $c$
