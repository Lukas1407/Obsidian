> [!abstract] Definition
>  HIFU is a noninvasive medical technology that uses **focused ultrasound waves** to treat or ablate tissue in a precise and targeted manner.
>  HIFU concentrates high-intensity energy at a specific focal point within the body, allowing for localized treatment without affecting surrounding healthy tissue.

- The waves are focused using specialized transducers to create a high-energy beam at a specific depth within the body.
- At the focal point, the ultrasound energy generates **heat**, which can raise tissue temperature and cause **coagulation necrosis** (cell death).

## Applications of HIFU
### Oncology:
HIFU is used to treat localized tumors in various organs, including the prostate, breast, liver, and kidneys.
It offers a minimally invasive alternative to surgery or radiation therapy.
### Urology:
HIFU is used for prostate cancer treatment.
It can precisely target cancerous tissue while preserving healthy prostate tissue.
### Gynecology:
HIFU is used for uterine fibroid treatment.
It can shrink or destroy fibroids without surgery.
### Neurology:
HIFU is used to treat essential tremors and Parkinson’s disease.
It can create lesions in specific brain regions to reduce tremors.
## Advantages of HIFU:
Noninvasive: No incisions or anesthesia required.
Precise Targeting: Focused treatment minimizes damage to healthy tissue.
Minimal Recovery Time: Patients can resume normal activities quickly.
## Limitations and Considerations:
Depth Limitation: HIFU is most effective at shallow depths (e.g., prostate, breast).
Monitoring: Real-time imaging (such as MRI) is often used during HIFU procedures.
Patient Selection: Not suitable for all patients or conditions.
