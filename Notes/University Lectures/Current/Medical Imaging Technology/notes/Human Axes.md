The human body is three dimensional, therefore we use three different axes to describe it. 
- The CC (Cranio-Caudal) or SI (Superior-Inferior) axis goes from the head to the feet
- The LL (Latero-Lateral) or LR (Left-Right) axis goes from the left side to right side of the body 
- The AP (Anterior-Posterior) axis goes from the front of the body to the back.
