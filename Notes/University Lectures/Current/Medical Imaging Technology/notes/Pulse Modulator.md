- **Function:** The pulse modulator takes the continuous wave generated by the frequency synthesizer and "chops" it into short bursts or pulses, typically lasting 1-5 milliseconds. These are known as RF pulses.
- **Pulse Shaping:** These bursts are then shaped according to the specific requirements of the imaging application. Pulse shaping is crucial as it affects the efficiency of energy transfer to the spins, the type of contrast in the images, and the overall image quality.
