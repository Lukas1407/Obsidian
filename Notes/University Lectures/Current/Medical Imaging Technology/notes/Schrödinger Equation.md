- The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the wave function $\Psi$ of a particle evolves over time.
## Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation
$$i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$$
- $i$ is the imaginary unit.
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.
- $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the wave function dependent on position $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$.
- $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator representing the total energy of the system.
## Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
- for systems where the potential energy does not depend on time
$$\hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}) = E \Psi(\mathbf{r})$$

- $E$ is the energy eigenvalue of the system.
- $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$ is the wave function dependent only on position
