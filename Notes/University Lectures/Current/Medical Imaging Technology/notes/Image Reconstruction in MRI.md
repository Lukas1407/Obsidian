The approach involves using Fourier transforms to convert time-domain signals (from MRI scans) into frequency-domain information, which is then used to construct images.

## Basic Principle of MRI Image Reconstruction

### MRI Signal Acquisition:
   - In MRI, the signal is generated by nuclear spins within a magnetic field. When an external radiofrequency pulse is applied, these spins are excited from their equilibrium state.
   - After the pulse is turned off, the spins return to equilibrium, emitting a signal known as Free Induction Decay (FID). This signal is time-dependent and contains information about both the amplitude and phase of the magnetic spins.
### Fourier Transform:
   - The key to MRI image reconstruction lies in the [[Fourier Transform]]. The spatial distribution of spins (which directly correlates to the image) is encoded in the phase and frequency of the FID signal.
   - By applying the FT to the FID signals, one can translate these signals from the time domain into the frequency domain. The result is a complex image in the Fourier space (or k-space), where each point represents a specific frequency and phase encoding.
### Image Reconstruction:
   - The reconstructed image in the spatial domain (the MRI image that we see) is obtained by performing an inverse Fourier Transform of the data collected in the k-space. This transformation decodes the frequency and phase information back into spatial coordinates.
## Example Provided
The example you provided uses a mathematical approach to illustrate how the phase information in signals affects the combined signal, which is crucial in understanding MRI data processing:
- **Signals A and B**:
  - Both have the same frequency but different phases: $A(t) = \sin(\omega t + \phi_A)$ and $B(t) = \sin(\omega t + \phi_B)$.
- **Combining Signals**:
  - When these two signals are combined (simulating the addition of signals from different spatial locations but the same frequency due to the MRI slice selection), the resulting signal can be expressed using the prosthaphaeresis formulas:
  - $A(t) + B(t) = 2 \sin(\omega t + \frac{\phi_A + \phi_B}{2}) \cos(\frac{\phi_A - \phi_B}{2})$.
  - This results in a new signal where the amplitude is modulated by the cosine term, representing the difference in phase between A and B, and the sine term, which is a shift by the average of the phases.
### Importance in MRI
- **Phase Information**:
  - The phase information ($\phi_A$ and $\phi_B$) is crucial because it encodes the spatial position of the signal sources. Without being able to differentiate $\phi_A$ from $\phi_B$, the specific source locations in the xy-plane remain ambiguous. This is why multiple measurements with different phase encodings are necessary in MRI to fully reconstruct an image.
- **Fourier Transform**:
  - By varying the phase encoding gradients during the scan, MRI can sample the k-space at different frequencies and phases. This diversity allows for the full reconstruction of the image when an inverse Fourier Transform is applied, mapping back to spatial coordinates from frequency and phase data.
