> [!abstract] Definition
>  IVUS stands for Intravascular ultrasound and is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the interior of blood vessels, primarily coronary arteries. To get into the vessels, a catheter is used, which is a thin, flexible tube. The tip of the IVUS catheter is equipped with a small ultrasound transducer that emits high-frequency sound waves. As the sound waves encounter different tissues and structures within the blood vessels, they are partially reflected back to the transducer.

- The reflected waves are then turned into real-time pictures showing the inside of blood vessels. These pictures give detailed views of how the walls of the vessels are structured. They can show if there's plaque or any other issues.
- IVUS is really important for checking how much plaque has built up in the arteries around the heart. It helps doctors, usually heart specialists called cardiologists, see inside blood vessels very clearly, much better than other methods.
## Vessel Layers Visualized by IVUS:
- **Intima**: The innermost layer in contact with blood; crucial for vessel function and preventing clotting.
- **Lumen**: The central hollow space where blood flows; surrounded by the intima.
- **Media**: The middle layer composed of smooth muscle and elastic fibers; provides structural support.
- **Adventitia**: The outermost layer; offers additional support and protection.
