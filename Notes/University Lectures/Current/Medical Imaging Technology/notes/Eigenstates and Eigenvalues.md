In quantum mechanics, eigenstates are special solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation. Each eigenstate corresponds to a specific energy level or principal state of the system$$\hat{H} \psi_n(\mathbf{r}) = E_n \psi_n(\mathbf{r})$$
- $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator.
- $\psi_n(\mathbf{r})$ is the eigenstate or wave function associated with the energy $E_{n}$
- The corresponding energies $E_{n}$​ are known as eigenvalues. They are quantized, meaning the system can only have specific, discrete energy levels.

### Principal States (Eigenstates)
1. **Eigenstate Contribution**: Each eigenstate ψn(r)\psi_n(\mathbf{r})ψn​(r) contributes to the overall wave function, and its contribution oscillates in time.
2. **Orthogonality**: Eigenstates are orthogonal, meaning they are independent and form a complete basis for the system. This allows the wave function to be expressed as a sum of these independent oscillating terms.
3. **Physical Interpretation**: The presence of multiple harmonically oscillating terms means the particle’s state is a combination of different energy levels, each evolving independently over time.
