- The nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei and several neutrons, releasing a large amount of energy.
- $$^{A}_{Z}\textrm{X} \rightarrow {}^{A_1}_{Z_1}\textrm{Y} + {}^{A_2}_{Z_2}\textrm{Z} + \text{neutrons}$$
## Characteristics
- **Heavy Elements**: Common in very heavy elements like uranium and californium.
- **Energy Release**: Significant energy is released, used in nuclear reactors and atomic bombs.
