> **Alpha decay** is a type of **[[Radioactive Decay|radioactive decay]]** in which an atomic nucleus emits an **alpha particle**, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, a 2+ charged Helium-ion ($^{4}_{2}\textrm{He}^{2+}$)

- It happens because an unstable particle decays into the next particle in the chain + $^{4}_{2}\textrm{He}^{2+}$ until the particle is stable
- During alpha decay, the atomic mass number of the newly formed atom is reduced by **four**, and the atomic number is reduced by **two**: $$^{A}_{Z}\textrm{X} \rightarrow ^{A-4}_{Z-2}\textrm{Y} + ^{4}_{2}\textrm{He}^{2+}$$
- When the alpha particle is emitted, the parent nucleus experiences a recoil similar to how a gun recoils when a bullet is fired. This is however considered negligible due to its much larger mass compared to the alpha particle.
- The kinetic energy of the emitted alpha particle is relatively fixed and specific to the decaying nucleus.
- Because the kinetic energy of the alpha particle is well-defined and discrete, the alpha particles produce a line spectrum. Each line corresponds to a specific energy, which can be used to identify the emitting nuclide.

- Alpha decay can be induced by a neutron: $$^{A}_{Z}\textrm{X} + n\rightarrow ^{A+1}_{Z}\textrm{X}+\gamma \rightarrow ^{A-3}_{Z-2}\textrm{Y} + ^{4}_{2}\textrm{He}^{2+}$$
## Examples
A well-known example of alpha decay is the decay of **uranium-238**: $$^{238}_{92}\textrm{U} \rightarrow ^{234}_{90}\textrm{Th} + ^{4}_{2}\textrm{He}^{2+}$$
## Example: Radium-226 Alpha Decay
$$^{226}_{88}\textrm{Ra}\rightarrow ^{222}_{86}\textrm{Rn}+^{4}_{2}\textrm{He}$$
- **Parent Nucleus**: Radium-226.
- **Daughter Nucleus**: Radon-222.
- **Alpha Particle**: Helium-4 nucleus.
### [[Energetics|Q-Value Calculation]]
$$\begin{align} Q=M_{Ra}+M_{Rn}-M_{He} \\ = 23.69-16.39-2.42 \\=4.88 \text{ MeV} \end{align}$$
- The energy released ($Q$-value) is 4.88 MeV.
### Kinetic Energy Distribution
- **Kinetic Energy of Alpha Particle ($E_\alpha$​)**:$$E_{\alpha}=\frac{m}{m+M}\times Q$$
	- $m$: Mass of the alpha particle.
	- $M$: Mass of the daughter nucleus (radon-222).
- $$E_{\alpha}=\frac{4}{4+222}\times4.88\approx4.79\text{ MeV}$$
- The alpha particle receives approximately 4.79 MeV of the total energy.
- **Kinetic Energy of Recoil Nucleus ($E_{N}$​)**:$$E_{N}=\frac{M}{m+M}\times Q$$
- The recoil nucleus gets the remaining energy due to the conservation of momentum.
- $$E_{N}=\frac{222}{226}\times4.88\approx0.09\text{ MeV}$$
- The recoil energy of the radon-222 nucleus is approximately 0.09 MeV.
### Decay Scheme
![[Pasted image 20240611124224.png#invert|250]]
- The figure shows the energy levels and the probabilities of decay pathways.
- 94.4% of radium-226 decays emit an alpha particle leading to an excited state of radon-222 which then de-excites by emitting gamma rays.
- **4.785 MeV**: The main alpha emission with 94.4% intensity.
- **4.602 MeV**: A less common alpha emission with 5.5% intensity.
- **0.186 MeV**: Gamma radiation from excited states.


## Energy 
- Alpha particles are relatively **large** and have a **positive charge**.
- -> They produce a lot of energy because $e=mc^2$
- 3-7 MeV
## Penetration
- However, alpha particles are **not very penetrating**:
- Their penetration in water/soft tissue is only 0.01-0.1 mm
- Due to their limited penetration, alpha particles are **not viable for imaging** within the body.

## Quantum Mechanical Explanation of Alpha Decay
![[Pasted image 20240611123234.jpg|600]]
- The diagram depicts the potential energy barrier that an alpha particle within a nucleus must overcome to escape. 
- This explanation is framed within the context of quantum tunneling, which allows particles to pass through potential barriers that they classically should not be able to surmount.
### Potential Energy Curve
- The curve shows the potential energy of an alpha particle as a function of the distance from the center of the nucleus.
	- **Inside the Nucleus**: Within the potential well, the alpha particle is bound by the nuclear force, experiencing a high potential barrier due to the strong nuclear force.
	- **Outside the Nucleus**: Once beyond the potential barrier, the alpha particle experiences a lower potential and can escape from the nucleus.
### Alpha Particle Energy
- The energy of the alpha particle is shown as a horizontal line. In this example of polonium-212, the alpha particle has an energy of 8.95 MeV, which is less than the height of the potential barrier.
### Quantum Tunneling
- Despite the barrier being higher than the alpha particle's energy, quantum mechanics allows the particle to "tunnel" through the barrier. 
- This phenomenon occurs because there is a finite probability that the alpha particle can exist on the other side of the barrier, despite not having enough energy to overcome it classically.
