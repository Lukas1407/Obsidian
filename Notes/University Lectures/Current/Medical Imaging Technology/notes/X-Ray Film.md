- X-ray film consists of several layers:
    - **Base**: A polyester base that provides support for the emulsion layers.
    - **Emulsion Layer**: An approximately 10 μm-thick layer containing silver halide grains.
        - Most radiographic films have emulsion layers on both sides of the base.
        - These grains are sensitive to either X-ray radiation or light.

- The silver halide grains (approximately 1 μm in diameter) are the key to capturing the latent image.
- Sensitization occurs when these grains absorb either X-ray radiation or light.
- When sensitized, the grains form a latent image that can be developed chemically.
## Latent Image Formation
- Exposure of the crystal to photons (either X-rays or light) results in the release of electrons.
- Free interstitial silver ions (with a positive charge) are attracted to the negatively charged sensitivity sites within the grains.
- When the silver ions reach the sensitivity site, they acquire an electron and become neutral silver atoms.
- These neutral silver atoms constitute the latent image sites within the emulsion layer.
## Intensifying Screens
- Intensifying screens are used in conjunction with X-ray film to enhance image exposure.
- They contain phosphor crystals that absorb X-rays and convert their energy into visible light.
- For each X-ray absorbed by the screen, hundreds of visible light photons are produced.
- The screen effectively converts the X-ray pattern into a light pattern, which then exposes the film.

## **Pros and Cons of X-Ray Film**:
- **Pros**:
    - Good spatial resolution (ability to distinguish fine details).
- **Cons**:
    - No real-time imaging (film must be developed).
    - Low efficiency (only a small fraction of X-rays are absorbed and contribute to the image).
    - Low contrast (limited ability to differentiate between different tissues).
    - No post-processing capabilities (unlike digital systems).
