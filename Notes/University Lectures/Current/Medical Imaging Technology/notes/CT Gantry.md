## Configurations
### 1st Generation (Translate-Rotate)
- Introduced in **1971**, the first-generation CT scanners used a single X-ray tube and a single detector.
- The X-ray tube emitted a narrow, pencil-like beam of X-rays, which was detected after passing through the patient.
- Both the X-ray tube and the detector moved in a linear (translating) motion across the patient, followed by a small rotation to a new angle, and this process was repeated multiple times to cover different angles around the patient.
- This method was quite slow, taking about **five minutes** to acquire a single image, typically of the head

### 2nd Generation (Translate-Rotate with Fan Beam)
- By **1974**, the second-generation CT scanners were introduced with a significant improvement: the use of a fan beam instead of a pencil beam.
- The fan beam had a wider angle (about **10°**), which allowed for the use of a detector array rather than a single detector.
- This meant that more of the patient’s anatomy could be imaged in one gantry position, reducing the number of translations needed and thus decreasing the acquisition time to about **one to two minutes** per image

### 3rd Generation (Rotate-Rotate)
- The third generation came quickly after the second, in **1975**.
- It featured an even wider fan beam angle (**45-55°**) and a curved detector array that matched the fan beam’s size.
- The curved array was always oriented towards the patient, eliminating the need for the translating motion.
- The X-ray tube and the detector array rotated around the patient in a full **360°** motion, covering all necessary angles in one continuous movement.
- This innovation significantly reduced the image acquisition time to **less than one minute**

### 4th Generation (Rotate-Stationary)
- The fourth generation, while similar to the third, introduced a stationary detector array that encompassed a full **360°** around the patient.
- Only the X-ray tube rotated, moving in front of the stationary detector ring.
- This configuration further reduced the image acquisition time compared to the third generation.
- However, despite its speed, the fourth generation was not widely adopted due to its high cost and the fact that the speed increase was not deemed necessary for most clinical applications
