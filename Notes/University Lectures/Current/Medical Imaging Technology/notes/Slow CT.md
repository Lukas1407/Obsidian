- Acquired very slowly, the pitch is small (usually around p=0.5). It involves scanning using a slow rotation speed to capture tumour motion during each slice acquisition
- The final result is the convex hull of the positions occupied by moving structures
- Can be used only for planning purposes

## Advantages
- patients can continue to be imaged and treated under free-breathing conditions
- an easy technique to implement on existing CT scanners and does not require investment in additional equipment
## Drawbacks
- we see something moving several times, interpolating of the slices: we are obtaining an average. Because of that the exact tumour size and shape are unknown and the surrounding anatomy will also be blurred
- can be used only for planning purposes
- lot of dose to patient
