> [!abstract] Definition
> The linear attenuation coefficient is a measure of how much a material weakens or reduces the strength of X-Ray as it passes through. It's like a measure of how effective a material is at absorbing or blocking radiation.

- The linear attenuation coefficient <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">depends on the properties of the material</mark> and the energy of the beam.
- It <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">increases with the atomic number</mark> $Z$ <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">and density</mark> $\rho$ of the material.
- It generally <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">decreases with increasing energy</mark> of the beam $E$, except at specific energies known as K-edges, where there is a sudden increase.

## Mass Attenuation Coefficient
- By normalizing the linear attenuation coefficient over the material density $\rho$, we obtain the mass attenuation coefficient $\frac{\mu}{\rho}$, which is less dependent on the physical state of the material
