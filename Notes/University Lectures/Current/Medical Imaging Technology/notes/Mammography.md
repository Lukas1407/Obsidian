## Tissues in the Mammary Gland
![[Pasted image 20240511113557.png|200]]
- **Galactophore Ducts (A)**: These are the milk ducts that transport milk from the glandular tissue to the nipple.
- **Glandular Tissue (B)**: This tissue produces milk and is primarily involved when screening for cancer.
- **Sinuses of Galactophore Ducts ©**: These are dilated parts of the milk ducts where milk accumulates before being excreted.
- **Nipple (D)**: The protruding part through which milk is excreted.
- **Fat (E)**: Adipose tissue that surrounds and protects the other components of the breast.
- **Pectoral Muscles (F)** and **Ribs (G)**: While part of the chest anatomy, ribs are not typically of interest in mammography.
## Process
- To visualize the soft tissues of the breast, mammography uses <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">low-energy X-rays</mark>, typically around 30 keVp. 
	- This energy level is chosen because it <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">provides better contrast between the different types of soft tissues</mark>.
	- At higher energies, there is little difference in the attenuation between glandular tissue and cancer cells. 
	- However, at lower energies, cancerous lesions can be more easily distinguished.
- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">anode in the X-ray tube is made of molybdenum</mark>, which is used because of its characteristic radiation that is suitable for imaging soft tissues like those in the breast.
- A <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">filter is used to cut off high-energy X-rays</mark>, as these would not significantly contribute to the image quality and could increase the radiation dose to the patient.
### Procedure
![[Pasted image 20240511113953.png|400]]
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Only the breast is exposed to radiation</mark> to minimize unnecessary exposure to other parts of the body.
- The X-ray tube is tilted to get the best angle for imaging.
- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">breast is compressed</mark> between two plates to spread out the tissue for a clearer image.
- Two standard projections are taken:
    - **Cranio-caudal (CC)**: The X-ray beam passes from the top (cranial) to the bottom (caudal) of the breast.
    - **Medio Lateral Oblique (MLO)**: The X-ray beam passes at an oblique angle from the middle (medial) to the side (lateral) of the breast.
#### Why Breast Compression
- **Reduced Thickness**: Compressing the breast reduces its thickness, making it easier for X-rays to penetrate.
- **Lower Energy Requirement**: A thinner breast requires less radiation, reducing the patient’s exposure.
- **Uniform Image**: Compression evens out the breast tissue, leading to a more uniform image.
- **Reduced Absorbed Dose**: Less tissue thickness means less photoelectric absorption, which reduces the radiation dose needed.
- **Less Scatter**: Compression reduces the volume of tissue that can scatter radiation, minimizing the effects of Rayleigh and Compton scattering.
