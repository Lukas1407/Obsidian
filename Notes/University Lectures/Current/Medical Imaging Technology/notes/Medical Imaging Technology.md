> [!tldr] Definition
>  Medical Imaging Technologies were a true revolution in medical [[Diagnose|diagnostic]], as it allows to look inside the body in a non- or minimal-invasive manner. 
>  This resulted in a new paradigm for:
>  - Surgical procedures (planing and guidance)
>  - Treatment (continuous patient follow up)

- Each medical imaging modality offers different information as well as different characteristics like:
	- [[Image Resolution#Spatial Resolution|spatial resolution]] 
	- [[Image Resolution#Spectral Resolution|spectral resolution]] 
	- [[Image Resolution#Radiometric Resolution|radiometric resolution]]
	- [[Temporal Resolution]] 
	- [[Image Noise]]
	- [[Image Noise#Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR)|Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR)]]
	- [[Image Noise#Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)|Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)]]
	- [[Image Artifacts]]
- Which measure the image quality
- $\rightarrow$ each modality has its own use case $\rightarrow$ doctors need to learn when to apply which modality
- Over the years the technological developments have aimed at improving image quality while decreasing invasiveness to the patients and clinical operators, costs, and the size of instrumentation equipment. ^f54a09
## Classification
### Projections vs Tomographies
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Projections</mark> refers to techniques that create two-dimensional images by passing X-rays or other forms of radiation through the body.
	- The image is a projection of the body's structures onto a plane
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Tomographies</mark> comes from the Greek word _tomos_ (slice) and _graphia_ (writing), meaning "image of a slice". It involves creating images of cross-sections of the body
	- This allows for detailed three-dimensional reconstructions of the body’s internal parts.
### Energy source
- Images based on <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">spontaneous energy</mark> emission by the human body 
	- EEG and ECG maps, thermography, magneto-cardiography, magneto-encephalography
- Images based on the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">interaction of tissues with external energy source</mark> 
	- Electromagnetic energy: RX, [[Computed Tomography (CT)|CT]], [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)|MRI]], VIDEO 
	- Mechanical Energy: [[Ultrasound Imaging|US]]
- Images based on the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">interaction of tissues with internal energy source</mark>
	- [[Nuclear Imaging]]
### Provided Information
- Structural or Anatomical Images: These provide detailed information about the structure of organs and tissues.
	- Radiographs (X-rays): Show bones, lungs, and other dense structures.
	- [[Computed Tomography (CT)]]: Creates cross-sectional images of the body.
	- [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]]: Excellent for soft tissue visualization.
	- [[Ultrasound Imaging]]: Uses sound waves for real-time imaging.
	- [[Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)]]: High-resolution imaging of eye structures.
	- Video Endoscopy: Visualizes internal organs using a flexible tube with a camera.
- Functional Images: These reveal functionality or activity within the body.
	- Nuclear Imaging ([[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|PET]], [[Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)|SPECT]], [[Scintigraphy]]): Shows metabolic processes using radioactive tracers.
	- [[Functional MRI (fMRI)]]: Captures brain activity during tasks.
	- Diffusion-Weighted MRI (MRI-DWI): Detects water movement in tissues.
	- Doppler Ultrasound (Doppler-US): Measures blood flow velocity.
- Metabolic Images: These focus on metabolism and biochemical processes.
	- MRI Spectroscopy (MRS): Analyzes chemical composition in tissues.
	- [[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)]]: Maps metabolic activity.
	- [[Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)]]: Also used for metabolic imaging.
