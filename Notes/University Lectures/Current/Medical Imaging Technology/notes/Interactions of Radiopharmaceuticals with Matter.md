- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ particles loose their kinetic energy in a straight line due to their relatively large mass and charge.
- In matter, their range is very low
	- For [[Alpha Particles]] typically less than 1 mm
	- for [[Beta Particles]] typically 1-3 mm
- [[Gamma Ray|Gamma rays]] on the other hand can travel much further through matter than alpha or beta particles because they do not have mass or charge. Gamma rays lose energy primarily through interactions with matter via three processes:
	1. **Photoelectric Effect**: A gamma ray photon transfers all its energy to an electron, which is then ejected from the atom.
	2. **Compton Scattering**: A gamma ray photon transfers part of its energy to an electron, and both the photon and the electron change direction.
	3. **Pair Production**: A gamma ray photon converts its energy into an electron-positron pair when it passes close to the nucleus of an atom.
