- Biological substances (such as pharmaceuticals) decrease in their concentration in the body through processes like metabolism
- This decrease is exponentially just like with radioactive materials
- In the context of nuclear medicine, the **effective half-life** takes into account both the physical decay of the isotope and the biological clearance from the body.
- The formula to calculate the effective half-life is:$$\begin{align} \frac{1}{T_e} = \frac{1}{T_r} + \frac{1}{T_{b}}\\ \frac{1}{T_{e}}=\frac{T_{b}}{T_{r}*T_{b}}+ \frac{T_{r}}{T_{b}*T_{r}} \\ \frac{1}{T_{e}} = \frac{T_p \times T_b}{T_p + T_b} \end{align}$$
