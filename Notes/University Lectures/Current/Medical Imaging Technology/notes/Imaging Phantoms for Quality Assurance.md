- Imaging phantoms are crucial tools in the field of medical imaging and play a significant role in quality assurance (QA).

- **Stand-In for Human Tissue**:
    - Phantoms are designed to mimic the properties of human tissues, providing a consistent and controlled subject that can be used to test and calibrate imaging devices.
- **Quality Assurance**:
    - They are essential for QA because they help verify that imaging systems are producing accurate and reliable results. By using phantoms, technicians can ensure that the devices are properly calibrated and functioning as expected.
- **Design and Use**:
    - Phantoms come in various shapes and sizes, each tailored for specific types of imaging (e.g., MRI, CT, ultrasound). They contain structures that simulate different tissue types and densities.
- **Consistent Results**:
    - Because phantoms <span style="background:rgba(255, 159, 102, 0.48)"><span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">can be repeatedly imaged</span></span> under the same conditions, they provide a way to obtain consistent results, which is vital for maintaining the quality and safety of medical imaging.

- These phantoms allow for the evaluation of various parameters such as geometric accuracy, resolution, and scale calibration, which are critical for ensuring high-quality diagnostic images.
