- Quantum mechanics introduces the concept of wave-particle duality, where particles like protons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
##### Particle Properties
1. **Defined Position**: Particles, such as protons, have a specific location at any given time.
2. **Mass and Charge**: They possess mass and, in the case of protons, a positive electric charge.
3. **Interaction with Other Particles**: Protons can collide and interact with other particles in predictable ways, like billiard balls.
##### Wave Properties
1. **Wavelength**: Waves have a characteristic wavelength, which is the distance between consecutive peaks.
2. **Interference**: Waves can add together or cancel each other out, creating patterns of constructive or destructive interference.
3. **Diffraction**: Waves can bend around obstacles and spread out after passing through small openings.
##### The Duality
- When protons are fired at a double-slit, they create an interference pattern typical of waves. 
- However, if you observe them closely, they behave like particles passing through one slit or the other.
- **Quantum Superposition**: Protons exist in a superposition of states, where they can be in multiple positions or paths simultaneously until observed.
- De Broglie Hypothesis: Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles have a wavelength, given by the equation $$λ=\frac{h}{p}$$
	- where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $h$ is Planck’s constant, and $p$ is the momentum.
