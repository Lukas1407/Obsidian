> [!abstract] Definition
>  Fluoroscopy is an [[X-Ray Imaging|X-Ray based imaging technique]] where 2D images are acquired over time to create real-time video images of internal structures of the body.

- Fluorescent screens are used to convert X-ray photons into visible light photons
	- These screens are coated with materials like Caesium iodide. 
	- When X-rays hit these screens, they are converted into visible light photons. 
	- This conversion is possible because of the energy difference between X-ray photons (averaging 30-50 keV) and light photons (1-3 eV).
## Image Intensifier

- The visible light from the fluorescent screen then strikes a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">photocathode</mark>, this causes the photocathode to emit electrons.
- These electrons are accelerated towards an anode
- The electrons hit a second fluorescent screen made, which converts the electrons back into light photons.
### Brightness Gain
- The process results in a significant increase in brightness, typically <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">on the order of 5000-10000 times</mark>, depending on the field of view (FOV). 
- This gain <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">allows for a brighter image to be produced from a lower dose of X-rays</mark>.
### Current use of Image Intensifiers
The image intensifier has been slowly <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">substituted by flat panel detectors</mark> (since the 90s), because of
- higher efficiency  
- better image resolution 
- less bulkiness
but because of the noticeably higher costs you will still find many clinics to use image intensifiers instead.

## Clinical Uses
### Arthrography
- This is the visualization of a joint, such as the knee or shoulder, using a contrast material injected into the joint space to enhance the image detail.
### Hysterosalpingogram
- An X-ray test that examines the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes, often used in infertility investigations.
### Urography/Intravenous Pyelogram
- An imaging test that visualizes the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, typically using a contrast dye.
### Image-Guided Procedures
- Fluoroscopy provides real-time moving images, which is crucial for both diagnosing conditions and guiding interventions with precision and safety. 
- The ability to see internal structures in motion helps healthcare providers perform procedures with minimal invasiveness and increased accuracy
1. **Placement of Intravenous (IV) Catheters**: Fluoroscopy helps guide the placement of catheters into veins or arteries for medication delivery or diagnostic testing.
2. **Biopsy**: Itâ€™s used to guide needles to the precise location within the body to obtain a tissue sample for testing.
3. **Spine Punctures**: Also known as lumbar punctures, fluoroscopy assists in guiding the needle to the correct spot in the lower back to collect cerebrospinal fluid.
