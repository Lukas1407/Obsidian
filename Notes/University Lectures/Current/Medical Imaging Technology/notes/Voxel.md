- A **voxel** is the fundamental unit of a **3D volume** or **3D image**.
- It extends the concept of a pixel into the third dimension.
- Voxel data is commonly used in medical imaging (such as CT scans and MRI) and computer graphics.
- Each voxel represents a small volume element within the 3D space.
- In medical imaging, voxels store information about tissue density, attenuation, or other properties.
