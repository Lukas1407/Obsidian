- A **pixel** is the fundamental unit of a **2D image**.
- It represents a single point in an image grid.
- Each pixel stores information about color, intensity, or other attributes.
- In digital images, pixels are arranged in rows and columns to form the entire image.
- For example, in a grayscale image, each pixel might represent a different shade of gray, while in a color image, each pixel contains information about red, green, and blue components.
