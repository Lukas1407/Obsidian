> [!tldr] Definition
> Fourier transform is a mathematical operation which maps any function (also aperiodic) in the time domain to the frequency domain.
> It decomposes a signal (or function) into oscillatory functions with a certain frequency.

- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">high frequencies</mark> contribute to the fast varying parts of the signal (sharp transitions)
	- They carry the information
- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">low frequencies</mark> contribute to the slow variations of the signal in the time domain
	- They carry the base line signal

## 2D Fourier Transform
- A 2D signal can be also broken up into 2D-sinusoidal
## Discrete Fourier Transform
- The DFT is used to analyze the **frequency content** of discrete signals.
- It transforms a sequence of complex numbers from the **time domain** into the **frequency domain**.
- The DFT provides a **frequency domain representation** of the original input sequence.
- It’s particularly useful because many signals can be more easily analyzed and manipulated in the frequency domain than in the time domain.
