>  Dual-energy CT (DECT), also known as spectral CT, is an advanced imaging technique that captures images using two distinct X-ray energy levels, typically high-energy (HE) and low-energy (LE).

## Different Energy Levels
- In DECT, materials are exposed to X-rays at two different energy levels. This is because materials have unique attenuation characteristics at different energies, meaning they absorb X-rays to varying degrees
- Some materials, like iodine and calcium, show significant differences in attenuation between high and low energy levels. This property is utilized in DECT to differentiate between various materials within the body 
- DECT acquires images at both energy levels and uses mathematical algorithms to separate the contributions of different materials in the scanned region. This process is known as material decomposition 
- The decomposition is achieved through complex mathematical algorithms and calibration procedures that consider the differences in X-ray attenuation of materials at the two energy levels. These algorithms can identify and quantify specific substances within the body, such as iodine in contrast agents or calcium in bones
