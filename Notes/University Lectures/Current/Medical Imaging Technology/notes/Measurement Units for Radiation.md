## Radioactivity
> [!abstract] Definition
> Radioactivity refers to the emission of ionizing radiation from a material due to the decay of unstable atomic nuclei. 
### Units
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Curie (Ci)</span>: Commonly used in the United States. One curie represents the activity of 1 gram of radium-226, which emits 3.7 x 10^10 disintegrations per second.
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Becquerel (Bq)</span>: The international metric unit. One becquerel represents one disintegration per second. It is the SI unit for radioactivity.
## Exposure
> [!abstract] Definition
> Exposure measures the amount of ionizing radiation traveling through the air. 
### Units
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Roentgen</span>: Commonly used in the United States. It quantifies the ionization produced by x-rays or gamma rays in air.
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Coulomb/kilogram (C/kg)</span>: The international metric unit. It measures the charge produced per kilogram of air by ionizing radiation.
## Absorbed Dose:
> [!abstract] Definition
> Absorbed dose represents the amount of radiation energy absorbed by an object or person. 
### Units
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Radiation Absorbed Dose (rad)</span>: Commonly used in the United States. One rad corresponds to the absorption of 100 ergs of energy per gram of tissue.
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Gray (Gy)</span>: The international metric unit. One gray represents the absorption of 1 joule of energy per kilogram of tissue.
## Dose Equivalent (Effective Dose)
> [!abstract] Definition
> Dose equivalent combines the absorbed dose with the biological effects of different types of radiation. 

### Units
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Roentgen Equivalent Man (rem)</span>: Commonly used in the United States. It accounts for the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of different radiation types.
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Sievert (Sv)</span>: The international metric unit. One Sievert represents the same biological effect as one gray of absorbed dose, adjusted for the RBE of the radiation.
- <span style="background:rgba(255, 183, 139, 0.55)">Millirem (mrem)</span>: A sub-unit of rem, commonly used for practical measurements. It is equal to 1/1000th of a rem.
