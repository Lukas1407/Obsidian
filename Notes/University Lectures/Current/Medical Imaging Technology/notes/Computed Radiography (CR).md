- CR is a digital imaging technique that replaces traditional X-ray film with photostimulable phosphor plates.
- The equipment used for CR is similar to that used in analog radiography.
- Instead of film, CR employs phosphor plates (e.g., barium fluorobromide with europium, BaFBr:Eu).
- These phosphor plates capture X-ray energy and store it as latent images.
## Phosphor Plates
- When an X-ray photon is absorbed by the phosphor layer, it excites the phosphor material.
- Electrons within the phosphor become trapped in an excited state (metastable state) and remain there for a period.
- This trapped energy represents the latent image, containing information about the location of the X-ray exposure.
## Stimulation and Emission
- To read the latent image, the phosphor plate is illuminated (stimulated) using a red or infrared laser beam (typically emitting light at around 630-680 nm).
- The trapped electrons return to their ground state, emitting visible light (around 400 nm, blue light).
Optical fibers collect this emitted light and direct it to a photomultiplier tube (PMT).
## Signal Conversion and Digitization
- The PMT interprets the emitted light and converts it into an electrical signal.
- An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) digitizes this signal, mapping it onto a pixel matrix.
- The resulting digital image can be viewed on a screen or printed.
## Pros and Cons of CR
- **Pros**:
    - Phosphor plates can be erased (using bright light) and reused, making them cost-effective over time (average lifespan of about 10 years).
    - CR offers a better dynamic range compared to traditional films.
- **Cons**:
    - CR does not provide real-time imaging (requires processing).
    - Despite being digital, CR still requires a relatively high dose to achieve good contrast.
