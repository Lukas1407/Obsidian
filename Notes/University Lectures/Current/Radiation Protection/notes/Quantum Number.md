> [!abstract] Definition
> Quantum numbers are sets of numerical values that provide solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the electron in an atom. They describe the unique quantum state of an electron and are essential for determining the electron's location and energy within an atom. 

- There are four primary quantum numbers:
## Principal Quantum Number ($n$)
- The principal quantum number indicates the main [[Atom Energy Levels|energy level or shell]] in which the electron resides.
- It determines the average distance of the electron from the nucleus and, therefore, the size of the electron cloud.
- n can be any positive integer ($1, 2, 3, \ldots$).
- Larger $n$ values correspond to higher energy levels and larger [[Orbitals|orbitals]].
## Angular Momentum Quantum Number ($l$)
- The angular momentum quantum number defines the shape of the [[Orbitals|orbital]] in which the electron is likely to be found.
- It determines the [[Atom Energy Levels#Sub-Shells|sub-shell]] within a given principal energy level.
- $l$ can take on integer values from $0$ to $n−1$:
	- $l=0$: $s$-orbital (spherical)
	- $l=1$: $p$-orbital (dumbbell-shaped)
	- $l=2$: $d$-orbital (cloverleaf-shaped)
	- $l=3$: $f$-orbital (complex shapes)
## Magnetic Quantum Number ($m_l$​)
- The magnetic quantum number specifies the orientation of the [[Orbitals|orbital]] in space relative to the three-dimensional axes.
- It indicates how many [[Orbitals|orbitals]] of a particular type (shape) are present within a sub-level.
- $m_l$​ can range from $-l$ to $+l$, including zero:
    - For $l=0$: $m_l = 0$
    - For $l=1$: $m_l = -1, 0, +1$ orbitals)
    - For $l=2$: $m_l = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2$ (5 orbitals)
    - For $l=3$: $m_l = -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3$ (7 orbitals)
## Spin Quantum Number ($m_s$)
- The spin quantum number describes the intrinsic spin of the electron, which is a fundamental property like charge or mass.
- $m_s$​ can be either $+\frac{1}{2}$​ or $-\frac{1}{2}$.
