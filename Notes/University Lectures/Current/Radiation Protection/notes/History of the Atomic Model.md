### Ancient Greece
- The idea was that all matter is composed of tiny, indivisible particles called "Atoms", meaning "uncuttable"
- The atoms determine the properties of matter
### 19th Century
#### John Dalton: 5 Postulates on Atoms (1808)
- Elements are made of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms.
- Atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties.
- Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed.
- Atoms combine in whole-number ratios to form compounds.
- Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms.
#### Mendeleev’s [[Periodic Table]]
- Elements are arranged in order of increasing [[Atom Notation|atomic mass]].
- Elements with similar properties recur at regular intervals (periodicity).
- -> Mendeleev’s periodic table helped predict the properties of undiscovered elements, highlighting the systematic nature of atomic behavior.

### 20th Century
#### C. Röntgen: Discovery of X-Rays (1895)
- Röntgen was experimenting with cathode rays (electrons) and noticed that a nearby fluorescent screen started glowing, even though it was shielded from the cathode rays by a black cardboard.
- He deduced that a new type of ray was being emitted, which could pass through solid objects and affect photographic plates.
#### H. Becquerel: Discovery of Spontaneous Radioactivity (1896)
- He discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that could fog photographic plates even without exposure to sunlight, indicating a new type of radiation
- This was the first observation of natural radioactivity -> certain elements spontaneously emit radiation
#### J.J. Thomson: Discovery of the Electron (1897)
- Thomson was experimenting with cathode rays in a vacuum tube.
- He observed that these rays were deflected by electric and magnetic fields, indicating they were made of particles.
- By measuring the deflection, he determined that these particles were much smaller than atoms and negatively charged.
#### Plum-Pudding Model of the Atom (1902)
- Atoms consist of a positively charged “pudding” with negatively charged electrons embedded in it.

- This was an early attempt to describe the internal structure of the atom.
- Although later replaced by more accurate models, it was crucial in moving beyond the idea of the atom as indivisible.
#### Rutherford’s Nuclear Model (1911)
- Atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons.
- The majority of the atom’s mass is concentrated in the nucleus.

#### Bohr’s “Quantum” Model (1913)
- Electrons orbit the nucleus in defined paths (orbits) with fixed energy levels.
- These orbits correspond to discrete energy levels, and electrons do not emit radiation while in these orbits.
- Bohr suggested that the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in its orbit is quantized and given by the equation: $$L = n \frac{\hbar}{2\pi}$$where:
	- $n$ is the [[Quantum Number|quantum number]] (a positive integer: $1, 2, 3, \ldots$) and $\hbar$ is Planck’s constant.
- -> This means the electron can only occupy certain allowed orbits where its angular momentum is an integral multiple of $\frac{h}{2\pi}$​
- Energy is absorbed or emitted when electrons jump between orbits.
#### A. Sommerfeld: 2nd Quantum Number (1916)
- Sommerfeld proposed that in addition to circular orbits, electrons could occupy elliptical orbits.
- Sommerfeld introduced a second quantum number $l$ to describe the shape of the orbit (circular or elliptical).
#### L. de Broglie: Wave/Particle Duality for “Massive Particles” (1924)
- Proposed the [[Wave-Particle Duality]]
- This concept was initially applied to photons and then extended to all particles.
- He introduced the idea that matter, just like light, exhibits wave-like behavior under certain conditions.
#### E. Schrödinger: Quantum Mechanical Atom (1926)
- Schrödinger formulated the [[Schrödinger Equation]], a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time.
- This approach provided a probability distribution for finding an electron in a certain position, introducing the concept of [[Orbitals|atomic orbitals]].
#### W. Heisenberg: Uncertainty Principle (1927)
- [[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]]
