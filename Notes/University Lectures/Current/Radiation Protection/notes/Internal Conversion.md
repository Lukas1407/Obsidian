> [!abstract] Definition
> Internal conversion is a process where the energy from the excited state of a nucleus is directly transferred to an electron in an atom, usually one in the inner shell. 

- This transfer of energy causes the electron to be ejected from the atom, leading to the emission of what is known as a conversion electron.
- Unlike [[Gamma Decay]], where energy is released as a photon, internal conversion involves the ejection of an electron.
## Kinetic Energy of the Ejected Electron
- The kinetic energy of the ejected electron is the difference between the nuclear excitation energy and the binding energy of the electron in the shell.
- The energy formula: $$E_{e}=E^{*}-E_{B}$$
	- Here, $E^{*}$ is the energy of the excited state of the nucleus, and $E_{B}$​ is the binding energy of the electron that is being ejected.
## **Conversion Coefficient $\alpha$
- The conversion coefficient is a measure of how often internal conversion occurs relative to gamma emission for a particular nuclear transition.
- It indicates the efficiency of the internal conversion process. A higher α\alphaα means more electrons are ejected relative to gamma photons emitted.
- The formula: $$\alpha = \frac{N_e}{N_\gamma}$$
	- $\alpha$ is approximately proportional to $Z^{3}$, meaning elements with higher atomic numbers have a greater likelihood of undergoing internal conversion.
