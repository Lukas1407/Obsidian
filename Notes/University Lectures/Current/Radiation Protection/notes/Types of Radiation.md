## Non-Ionizing Radiation
- **Definition**: Radiation that does not carry enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules, meaning it cannot remove tightly bound electrons.
- **Examples**: Typically includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and visible light. These are not included in the diagram, as the focus is on ionizing radiation.
## [[Ionizing Radiation]]
### Directly Ionizing Radiation (Charged Particles)
- **Definition**: Radiation consisting of charged particles that ionize atoms directly through [[Coulomb Force|Coulomb]] interactions (interactions with the electric field of electrons).
#### Light Charged Particles
- Particles with relatively low mass and charge.
- **Examples**:
    - **Electron**: A negatively charged particle.
    - **Proton**: A positively charged particle found in the nucleus.
    - **Muon**: A heavier counterpart of the electron, also negatively charged.
#### Heavy Charged Particle
- Particles with higher mass and charge
- **Examples**:
	- **Proton**: While also a light particle, here it is categorized for completeness.
	- **Î±-Particle (Alpha Particle)**: Consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons; positively charged and relatively heavy.
	- **Heavy Ions**: Ions of heavier elements that carry a charge, such as carbon ions used in some types of cancer therapy.
### Indirectly Ionizing Radiation (Neutral Particles)
- **Definition**: Radiation that does not directly ionize atoms but can produce secondary ionization by interacting with matter.
#### [[Photon]]
 - A quantum of electromagnetic radiation
-  **Examples**:
	- **X-Rays**: High-energy photons used in medical imaging.
	- **Gamma Rays**: Even higher energy photons typically emitted by nuclear reactions.
	- **Synchrotron Radiation**: High-energy photons emitted by charged particles accelerated in magnetic fields.
#### Neutron
- A neutral particle that can cause ionization indirectly
- **Examples**:
	- **Cold Neutrons**: Neutrons with low kinetic energy, used in materials research.
	- **Thermal Neutrons**: Neutrons with energy equivalent to the surrounding thermal environment.
	- **Fast Neutrons**: Neutrons with high kinetic energy, significant in nuclear reactions.
