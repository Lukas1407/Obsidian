- Max von Laue and later Henry Moseley used X-rays to study the crystal structure of materials.
- X-rays are diffracted when they interact with the regular spacing in a crystal lattice.
- The diffraction patterns can be used to determine the atomic arrangement in the crystal.
## Energy of Characteristic X-Rays Dependent on $Z^2$
- The energy of the characteristic X-rays increases with the square of the atomic number.
	- Higher $Z$ means more tightly bound electrons and thus greater energy differences between shells.
	- This leads to higher energy (and shorter wavelength) X-rays.
