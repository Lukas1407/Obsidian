> [!abstract] Definition
>  Dosimetry is the scientific process of quantifying an individualâ€™s exposure to radiation. It involves measuring, calculating, and assessing the radiation dose absorbed.

- The dose of radiation refers to the amount of energy deposited by ionizing radiation per unit mass of tissue. It is expressed in units of gray (Gy), where 1 Gy equals 1 joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of tissue.
- Not all radiation has the same biological effect, even if the absorbed dose is the same. To account for this, dosimetry uses weighting factors that adjust the calculated dose to reflect the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of different types of radiation. This adjusted dose is known as the equivalent dose, measured in sieverts (Sv).
	- Different types of radiation can have different effects
	- Different [[Organe|organs]] can respond differently
