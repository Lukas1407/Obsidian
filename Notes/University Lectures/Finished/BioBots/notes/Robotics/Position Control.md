> Position control means that the robot tries to reach a desired position or angle for each joint, regardless of the speed or force required.  

This is good for precise and accurate movements, such as picking up an object from a known location or following a predefined trajectory. 
However, position control can be problematic when the robot encounters unexpected obstacles or disturbances, as it may apply excessive force or overshoot the target.
