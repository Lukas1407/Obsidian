Idea: 
- Nature is the best example
- Simple
- Robust against noisy [[Sensor]] feedback
- Are incrementally designed, consisting of small components
- Complex behavior does not necessitates complex control!

## Hierarchical Control
- Control elements are placed hierarchically
- Higher layers produce targets for lower layers![[Pasted image 20240302134731.png#invert]]
## Reactive Control
- Meaning a tightly coupled [[Machine Perception|perception]] and actions
- Defines the following concepts:
### Embodiment: 
- The [[Robotics|robot]] has a physical presence
- Example: Fingertips to help [[Robot Grasping|grasping]], because as they deform they increase the surface
### Situatedness:
- The [[Robotics|robot]] is integrated in its environment
- Allows automated interactions without human intervention
- It is important to know and understand the perspective of the [[Robotics|robot]]
### Emergence:
- Intelligence arises through interaction with the environment

## Braitenberg Vehicles
- The motion of a vehicle is directly controlled by [[Sensor|sensors]], for example light sensors
![[Pasted image 20240303104617.png#invert|400]]
- Depending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors
- 2a drives away from a light source while 2b drives towards it
- This simple configuration results in behavior that may appear complex or even intelligent
