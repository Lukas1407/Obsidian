> [!summary] Definition
>  A humanoid robot is a [[Robotics|robot]] resembling the human body in shape. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body, for example, from the waist up. Some humanoid robots also have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as eyes and mouths.

-> There is no clear definition of "when" a [[Robotics|robot]] is considered humanoid.
It is however clear that a humanoid robot needs to have manipulative, perceptive and communicative abilities.

## Uncanny Valley
- A steep drop in acceptance when the [[Robotics|robot]] becomes realistic but not enough to be considered life-like

## Applications
- There is no real life application that is sure to need humanoid robots
- Application in a warehouse is the closest
- Firms like [[Boston Dynamics]] have no goal of applying humanoid robots to the real world
- Mostly as research tools
### Entertainment
- In theme parks
- As stunt men
### Demonstrative
- Their primary use is to demonstrate up-and-coming technologies
- Advancements in [[Motor Skills|motor skills]], such as walking, climbing

## Challenges
The main challenges in developing humanoid robots are:
1. Large amount of [[Robotics#Joint types|joints]]
2. Contact with humans
3. [[Machine Perception|Perception]] of the environment
4. Complex control
