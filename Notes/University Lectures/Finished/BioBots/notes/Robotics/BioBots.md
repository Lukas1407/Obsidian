> [!summary] Definition
> Biologically motivated [[Robotics|robots]] are primarily defined by their [[Locomotion|locomotion]] form, and thereby by the animal they are inspired from. 
## System Requirements
- Autonomous
- Energy self-sufficient (no wire)
- High flexibility
- Robust against disturbances
- Perception of internal and external states
- Adaptive control of behavior 
-  Extendable

## Classification based on Animal
1. Fish-based [[Robotics|Robots]]
2. Bird-based [[Robotics|Robots]]
3. Snake-based [[Robotics|Robots]]
	- True snake-based: move like a snake
	- Hybrid: has wheels
4. [[Humanoid Robots]]
	- Technically optimized: may not resemble actual human
	- Anthropomorphic: human-like
5. [[Legged Robots]]
	- One-legged
	- Two-legged
	- Four-legged: reptile- or mammal-based
	- Six-legged: insect-based
	- More-legged: spider-based

## Possible Applications
- Maintenance or inspection
- Exploring of high-risk environments (volcanoes, sea floor, pipelines)
- Prosthetic 
- Assistance
- Entertainment

## Requirements for the Computer Architecture
- Energy efficient
- Safety and Error-tolerant
- Real-time capability
- Weight
- Scalability
- Modular

## Energy Efficiency
- Can be reduced by reducing the [[Drag Coefficient]] $c_{d}$
