> Velocity control means that the robot tries to maintain a desired speed or angular velocity for each joint, regardless of the position or force required.  

This is good for smooth and continuous movements, such as scanning an area or tracking a moving object. 
However, velocity control can be problematic when the robot needs to stop or change direction quickly, as it may have a large position error or instability.
