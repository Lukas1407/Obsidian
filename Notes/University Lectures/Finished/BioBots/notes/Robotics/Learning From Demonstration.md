This is an important ability for humans, as is allows to intuitively learn from others by simply watching them perform a task. In humans this is done through [[Mirror Neurons]].
Allowing [[Robotics|robots]] to learn in a similar way would allow us to teach them in an intuitive way and to teach them complex tasks without programming.

## Kinesthetic Teaching
- The human moves the robot
- The goal is for the robot to replay that motion
- No learning/generalization is happening
- The most popular and easiest technique in industry
- Also known as behavior cloning
## Learning though Observation
- The robot sees the motion performed by the human or on a different robot
- Needs to transfer that motion to its own kinematics
- Learns from demonstrations
