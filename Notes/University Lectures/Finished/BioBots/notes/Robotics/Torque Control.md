> Torque control means that the robot tries to apply a desired force or torque for each joint, regardless of the position or velocity required.  

This is good for compliant and adaptive movements, such as grasping a fragile or unknown object or interacting with a human. 
However, torque control can be problematic when the robot needs to achieve a precise position or velocity, as it may have a large error or oscillation.
