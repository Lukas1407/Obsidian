> A proportional–integral–derivative controller continuously calculates an error value 
$e(t)$ as the difference between a desired set-point $r(t)$ and a measured process variable $y(t)$and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively).

- Term P is proportional to the current value of the error $e(t)$.
	-  For example, if the error is large, the control output will be proportionately large by using the gain factor $K_{p}$. Using proportional control alone will result in an error between the set point and the process value because the controller requires an error to generate the proportional output response. In steady state process conditions an equilibrium is reached, with a steady SP-PV "offset".
- Term I accounts for past values of the error $e(t)$ and integrates them over time to produce the I term. 
	- For example, if there is a residual error after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the error. When the error is eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. This will result in the proportional effect diminishing as the error decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.
- Term D is a best estimate of the future trend of the error $e(t)$, based on its current rate of change. It is sometimes called "anticipatory control", as it is effectively seeking to reduce the effect of the error by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or damping effect.

The overall control function is given as:$$u(t)=K_{\text{p}}e(t)+K_{\text{i}}\int _{0}^{t}e(\tau )\,\mathrm {d} \tau +K_{\text{d}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} e(t)}{\mathrm {d} t}}$$
