> [!summary] Definition
>  Artificial muscles, also known as muscle-like actuators, are materials or devices that mimic natural muscle and can change their stiffness, reversibly contract, expand, or rotate within one component due to an external stimulus (such as voltage, current, pressure or temperature).

## Types
### Mechanical Muscle

Linear to Angle Displacement Device (LADD)
Concentric Linear to Angle Displacement Device (CLADD)
### Polymer Muscles
A [[Polymer]] that can change its shape through external activations. 
For example:
- Electroactive polymer (EAP) is a polymer that exhibits a change in size or shape when stimulated by an electric field.
- Ionic EAP are polymers that can be actuated through the diffusion of ions in an electrolyte solution#
### Piezoelectric Muscles
Are based on the [[Piezoelectric Effect]] and exhibit very small linear actuation as a result of  [[Electrical Charge]].
### Pneumatic Muscles
Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) operate by filling a pneumatic bladder with pressurized air. Upon applying pressure to the bladder, volume expansion occurs, but is confined by braided wires around the bladder, resulting in a linear contraction along the axis of the actuator. This is also called the McKibben effect.

- Advantages:
	1. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Very lightweight</mark> because their main element is a thin membrane
	2. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Inherent compliant behavior</mark>: when a force is exerted on the PAM, it "gives in", without increasing the force in the actuation. This is an important feature when the PAM is used as an actuator in a robot that interacts with a human, or when delicate operations have to be carried out.
	3. In PAMs the force is not only dependent on pressure but also on their state of inflation. This is one of the major advantages; the mathematical model that supports the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">PAMs functionality is a non-linear system, which makes them much easier than conventional pneumatic cylinder actuators to control precisely</mark>. The relationship between force and extension in PAMs mirrors what is seen in the length-tension relationship in biological muscle systems -> the muscle follows the [[Hill Equation]]
