Neuromorphic Hardware is then concerned with replicating the key aspects of the human [[Brain|brain]] with hardware.

Such systems can efficiently model [[Spiking Neural Network]], as they are:
- Inspired by the human [[Brain|brain]]
- Have low energy consumption
- Are highly parallel
- Have an additional dimension: time
