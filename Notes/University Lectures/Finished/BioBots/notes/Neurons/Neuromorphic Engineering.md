>  Neuromorphic computing is an approach to computing that is inspired by the structure and function of the human [[Brain|brain]]. A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses **physical** artificial neurons to do computations.

A key part of neuromorphic engineering is to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">transfer the key aspects</mark> and benefits of [[Neuron|neuron]] circuits <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">to a technical/computer systems</mark>. As well as to understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.

[[Neuromorphic Hardware]] is then concerned with replicating the key aspects of the human [[Brain|brain]] with hardware.
