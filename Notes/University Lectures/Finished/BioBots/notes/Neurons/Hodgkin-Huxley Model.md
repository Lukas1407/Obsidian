The typical Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model treats each component of an excitable cell as an electrical element. 
The [[Zellmembran|lipid bi-layer]] is represented as a [[Capacitance]] ($C_{m}$). Voltage-gated [[Ion Channels|ion channels]] are represented by electrical [[Conductance]] ($g_n$, where $n$ is the specific ion channel) that depend on both voltage and time. Leak channels are represented by linear [[Conductance]] ($g_L$). The electrochemical gradients driving the flow of ions are represented by voltage sources ($E_n$) whose voltages are determined by the ratio of the intra- and extracellular concentrations of the ionic species of interest. Finally, [[Ion Pumps]] are represented by [[Current]] sources ($I_p$). The membrane potential is denoted by $V_m$.![[Pasted image 20240228091616.png#invert|]]
