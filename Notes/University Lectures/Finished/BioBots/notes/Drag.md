> In fluid dynamics, air resistance, more commonly known as drag is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid. 

Drag depends on the properties of the fluid and on the size, shape, and speed of the object. One way to express this is by means of the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">drag equation</mark>:$$F_{d}=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}c_{d}A,$$where: 
- $\rho$ is the density of the fluid
- $v$ is the speed of the object relative to the fluid
- $A$ is the [[Cross Sectional Area]], so the area the fluid pushes against
- $c_{d}$ is the [[Drag Coefficient]]
