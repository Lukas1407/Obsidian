> [!summary] Definition
> The drag coefficient, denoted as $c_{d}$ or $c_{w}$ is the resistance of an object in a fluid environment such as water or air. 

The drag coefficient is defined as $$c_{d}=\frac{2F_{d}}{\rho v^{2}A},$$where:
- $F_{d}$ is the **air resistance,** more commonly known as [[Drag]]
- $\rho$ is the density of the fluid
- $v$ is the speed of the object relative to the fluid
- $A$ is the [[Cross Sectional Area]], so the area the fluid pushes against

The lower the $c_{d}$ the better.
