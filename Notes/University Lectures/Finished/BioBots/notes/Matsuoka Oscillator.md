>  The Matsuoka oscillator is a neural network model that mimics the behavior of neurons in [[Central Pattern Generator|CPGs]].

## Key Features
- Adaptation: The Matsuoka oscillator includes an adaptive component that adjusts its output based on past activity. This adaptation allows it to respond to changing conditions.
- Mutual Inhibition: Neurons within the oscillator inhibit each other. This mutual inhibition leads to rhythmic patterns.
- Coupling Factors: Parameters like coupling strength influence the synchronization of multiple oscillators.
