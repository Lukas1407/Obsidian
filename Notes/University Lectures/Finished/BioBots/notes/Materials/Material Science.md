## Characteristics of Materials
### Density
- Measures the mass per volume$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$
### Stress
- The internal force being exerted$$\sigma=\frac{F}{A}$$
### Tensile Strength
- The maximum force a material can withstand while being pulled or stretched before breaking$$F_{tu}=\frac{F_{max}}{A}$$
- Also called Ultimate Stress Point
- This usually follows a function of the following form![[Pasted image 20240229085434.png#invert|strain-stress curve]]
### Strain
- The relative change in length of the material under force $$\epsilon=\frac{\Delta I}{I_{a}},$$with $\Delta I$ being the change in length and $I_{a}$ being the original length
### Young's modulus
- Measures the tensile or compressive stiffness when the force is applied lengthwise$$E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$$
