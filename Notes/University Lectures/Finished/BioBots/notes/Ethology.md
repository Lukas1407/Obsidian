Behavior is determined by three major factors: 
1. Inborn instincts
2.  Learning
3. Environmental factors
Behavior consists of:
- Voluntary movement
- Active noises
- Posture
- Communication attempts
Such behavior pattern can be lost or newly created as part of development of the organism.
## Instincts
> [!summary] Definition
> A largely inheritable and unalterable tendency of an organism to make a complex and specific response to environmental stimuli without involving reason.

- Is available directly after birth and usually necessary for survival
- Can include both inborn and learned components
### Fixed Action Patterns
- Occurs as a response to a specific stimuli, the so called sign stimuli

## Learning
### Habituation
- The animal learn not to respond to irrelevant stimuli
### Associative Learning
- A new response becomes associated with a specific stimuli
### Imprinting
- Enables the young to discriminate the members of their own species
### Teaching
- A highly specialized form of Learning in which the "teacher" (demonstrator) adjusts their behavior to increase the probability of the "pupil" (observer) achieving the desired end-result of the behavior
