> [!summary] Definition
>  Bionics or biological inspired engineering is the application of biological solutions found in nature to modern technology.

Due to the vast amount of problem solutions in nature, bionic has a lot of possible applications in a lot of different fields:
- Design
- Sensors
- Walking
- Architecture
- ...

A direct mapping from nature to technology is not always necessary or useful
- The most important aspects are sufficient
- Nature is usually to complex to copy today
## Examples of Bionic
1. Water-repellent fabric inspired from the lotus plant![[Pasted image 20240227075953.jpg|300]]
2. [[Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN)|Artificial Neurons]] inspired by the [[Brain]]
3. Winglets/Wingtip on plains which increase efficiency, inspired by large birds ![[Pasted image 20240227080205.jpg|300]]
4. [[Artificial Muscles]]

## Benefits of Bionic
- Acceptance is higher due to natural movement
- Usually light, robust, adaptable, learnable, optimal energy consumption, smooth movement 

## Biomechanic as a construction model
### 10 Principles of biological Constructions
1. Multiple functions integrated instead of splitting functions
2. Optimized as a whole
3. Multi-functional instead of mono-functional
4. Minimal energy consumption
5. Uses energy from the outside
6. Limited life time
7. Highly connected
8. Changes in small steps
9. Fine tuning to environment
10. Recycling
### Typical Characteristics of biological Materials
1. Multiple layers
2. Highly functional
3. Functional compartments
4. Usually ultra lightweight
5. Sandwich-construction
6. Self reparable
7. Limited life time
### Example: Bones
- Very high strength with very low weight![[DCTM_Penguin_UK_DK_AL1178399_wnmz3a.webp|400]]
- Hollow
- Is optimized in strength in direction of use, meaning the strength deteriorates when applied sideways or when pulling
