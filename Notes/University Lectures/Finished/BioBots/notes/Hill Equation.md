>  The Hill equation describes the relationship between  [[Muscle|muscle]] force and contraction velocity in the skeletal muscle during a contraction.

The equation is as follows:$$

(F+α)×(v+β)=β×(F_0​+α)=constant,$$where:
- $F$ is the muscle force 
- $v$ is the contraction velocity 
- $α$ and $β$ are empirical constants 
- $F_0$ is the maximal force at isometric contraction 

The contraction velocity and muscle force are inversely related: at high contraction velocity, the muscle force is low, and at low contraction velocity, high. The product of the two factors is constant. The cause for this relationship is the kinetics of the cross-bridge cycle.![[Pasted image 20240301092435.jpg#invert]]
