> [!summary] Definition
> A reflex is an involuntary action or response triggered by a specific stimulus. It occurs before the impulse reaches the brain, thanks to neural pathways called reflex arcs inside the [[Central Nervous System|CNS]].

## Reflex Types
### Unconditioned, inborn Reflexes
- Either fully developed at birth or developed during the maturation of the organism
- Are characterized by identical reactions and reaction sequences to similar stimuli among individuals of the same species
- May vary only in intensity, speed or severity
- Example: blink reflex
### Conditioned Reflex
- Are not inborn but learned
- Example: Ivan Petrovich Pavlov famous dog experiment: Some dogs were given food and a bell sound at the same time. After some time, the dogs started to produce digestive secretions even when they only heard the bell sound
### Intrinsic Reflexes
- The triggering stimulus and the reflex response occur in the same organ (usually [[Muscle|muscles]])
- The purpose of such muscular reflexes is to maintain or restore the respective posture by counter-regulation in case of external shocks or sudden changes in position
- Example: the well-known knee or patellar tendon reflex
### Extrinsic Reflexes
- Reflexes in which the stimulus-perceiving organ is not the organ that performs the reflex response
- Example: the corneal reflex: When the cornea of the eye is irritated by a gust of air, the eyelid is reflexively closed. The irritation occurs at a point that cannot react itself due to the lack of muscles; and the lid muscle, which is activated to protect the cornea, was not stimulated itself. 
- Extrinsic reflexes are learnable, unlike intrinsic reflexes.
### Coordinated Reflexes
- Reflexes in which a more or less large group of muscles is activated by a stimulus (possibly including the activation of other organs such as glands or heart and intestine and triggering other vegetative reactions).
