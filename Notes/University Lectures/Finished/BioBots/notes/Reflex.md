> [!summary] Definition
> A reflex is an involuntary action or response triggered by a specific stimulus. It occurs before the impulse reaches the brain, thanks to neural pathways called reflex arcs inside the [[Central Nervous System (CNS)|CNS]].

## Reflex Types
### Unconditioned, inborn Reflexes
- Either fully developed at birth or developed during the maturation of the organism
- Are characterized by identical reactions and reaction sequences to similar stimuli among individuals of the same species
- May vary only in intensity, speed or severity
- Example: blink reflex
### Conditioned Reflex
- Are not inborn but learned
- Example: Ivan Petrovich Pavlov famous dog experiment: Some dogs were given food and a bell sound at the same time. After some time, the dogs started to produce digestive secretions even when they only heard the bell sound
### Intrinsic Reflexes
- The triggering stimulus and the reflex response occur in the same organ (usually [[Muscle|muscles]])
- The purpose of such muscular reflexes is to maintain or restore the respective posture by counter-regulation in case of external shocks or sudden changes in position
- Example: the well-known knee or patellar tendon reflex
### Extrinsic Reflexes
- Reflexes in which the stimulus-perceiving organ is not the organ that performs the reflex response
- Example: the corneal reflex: When the cornea of the eye is irritated by a gust of air, the eyelid is reflexively closed. The irritation occurs at a point that cannot react itself due to the lack of muscles; and the lid muscle, which is activated to protect the cornea, was not stimulated itself. 
- Extrinsic reflexes are learnable, unlike intrinsic reflexes.
### Coordinated Reflexes
- Reflexes in which a more or less large group of muscles is activated by a stimulus (possibly including the activation of other organs such as glands or heart and intestine and triggering other vegetative reactions).
### Simple Reflex or Monosynaptic Reflex
- In this type of reflex, sensory information is transmitted by a sensory neuron to the spinal cord, where it directly communicates with a motor neuron.
- An example is the knee-jerk reflex, where tapping the patellar tendon stretches receptors in the quadriceps muscle. This stretch is detected by sensory neurons, which transmit a signal directly to motor neurons in the spinal cord. The motor neurons then immediately fire, causing the quadriceps to contract and the leg to jerk.
- This reflex involves only one synapse — the point of communication between the sensory neuron and the motor neuron — hence the term "monosynaptic."
#### Example: Flexor Reflex

- **Trigger**: Initiated by painful or harmful stimuli.
- **Response**: Causes a quick withdrawal of the affected part by flexing the muscles involved. For example, if you step on a sharp object, the flexor reflex causes you to lift your foot away from the object.
- **Function**: Protects the body from harm.
#### Example: Crossed Extensor Reflex
![[Pasted image 20240710091418.png#invert|400]]
- **Trigger**: Also initiated by painful stimuli.
- **Mechanism**:
    - Works in conjunction with the flexor reflex.
    - While the flexor reflex causes flexion (withdrawal) in the affected limb, the crossed extensor reflex activates the extension of the opposite limb.
- **Function**: Provides balance and support. For example, if the right foot steps on something painful and withdraws, the left leg will automatically extend to support the body's weight that is shifted due to the withdrawal of the right leg.
### Complex Reflexes
- These may involve multiple synapses and interneurons within the spinal cord or even require input from the brain. They allow for more graded responses to stimuli and involve integration of multiple sensory inputs to produce an appropriate response.
#### Example: Tonic Neck Reflex
![[Pasted image 20240710091439.png#invert|400]]
- **Trigger**: Movement of the head relative to the body.
- **Response**: Depending on the direction of the head's movement, there is a corresponding flexion or extension of the arms.
- **Occurrence**: This reflex is prominent in newborn humans and assists in developing muscle tone and coordination. Over time, as the nervous system matures, this reflex diminishes and becomes integrated into more voluntary and complex movements.
#### Example: Labyrinthine Righting Reflex
![[Pasted image 20240710091457.png#invert|400]]
- **Goal**: Maintains a balanced, upright posture.
- **Mechanism**:
    - Stimulated by the position of the head as influenced by the vestibular system (located in the inner ear, which senses balance and head position).
    - Sends signals to the spinal cord and brain to make adjustments to body posture and head position.
- **Response**: Involves coordinated movements of limbs and the neck to keep the head upright and the body balanced, crucial for effective orientation in space.
## Stretch Reflex
The **stretch reflex** is one of the most fundamental reflexes in the human body, primarily involved in maintaining muscle tone and adjusting it reflexively to maintain posture and balance.
![[Pasted image 20240710091344.png#invert|400]]
- **Mechanism**:
    - When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle (muscle spindle fibers) are activated.
    - These sensory neurons send a signal via afferent pathways to the spinal cord, where they synapse directly onto motor neurons that innervate the same muscle.
    - The motor neurons are stimulated to contract the muscle, effectively resisting the stretch and maintaining muscle length and limb position.

This reflex is exemplified by the knee-jerk reflex, a type of stretch reflex used in neurological examinations to test the integrity of the spinal cord segments and peripheral nerves.
