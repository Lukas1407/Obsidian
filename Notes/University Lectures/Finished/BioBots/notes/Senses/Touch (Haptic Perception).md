> Somatosensation is the group of sensory modalities that are associated with touch and [[Interoception]]. The modalities of somatosensation include pressure, vibration, light touch, tickle, itch, [[Temperature Perception]], pain, kinesthesia. Somatosensation, also called tactition (adjectival form: tactile) is a perception resulting from activation of neural receptors, generally in the skin including hair follicles, but also in the tongue, or throat.

- **Haptic perception** is the ability to understand and recognize objects through touch, combining both cutaneous (skin) sensations and kinesthetic (movement and position) information.
#### Components of Haptic Perception
1. **Tactile/Cutaneous Sensation**:
    - **Temperature**: Sensing hot and cold through thermoreceptors.
    - **Pressure**: Detection of how much an object presses against the skin.
    - **Vibration**: Sensing oscillations or movements through mechanoreceptors.
    - **Slip**: Detecting movement between the skin and the object.
    - **Pain**: Nociceptors trigger responses to potentially damaging stimuli.
2. **Proprioception/Kinesthesia**:
    - Involves sensing the position and movement of limbs and other parts of the body.
    - **End organs** like muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, and joint capsules help detect the stretch of muscles, tension in tendons, and the position of joints.
### Neural Pathways for Haptic Information
- **Signal Transmission**: Sensory signals from these receptors are transmitted via nerve fibers to the spinal cord and then relayed to the brain for further processing. This pathway allows for the integration and interpretation of sensory information, forming the basis of our haptic perceptions.
### Exploratory Procedures for Haptic Perception
Humans use specific manual exploratory procedures to interact with and identify object properties:

- **Procedures**:
    1. **Lateral Motion** (Texture)
    2. **Pressure** (Hardness)
    3. **Enclosure** (Volume, Shape)
    4. **Static Contact** (Temperature)
    5. **Unsupported Holding** (Weight)
    6. **Contour Following** (Exact Shape)

These movements are designed to optimize the sensory feedback from different types of receptors, helping to determine object characteristics such as texture, temperature, hardness, and shape.
