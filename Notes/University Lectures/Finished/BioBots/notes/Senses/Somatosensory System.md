> [!summary] Definition
>  The somatosensory system is the network of neural structures in the [[Brain]] and body that produce the  [[Perception|perception]] of [[Touch (Haptic Perception)]], as well as [[Temperature Perception]] (thermoception), body position ([[Proprioception]]), and [[Pain Perception]]. It is a subset of the [[Sensory Nervous System]], which also represents [[Vision]], [[Hearing]], [[Smell]], [[Taste]] and [[Vestibular]] stimuli.

### Integration and Processing
- The somatosensory system, which includes all these receptors, is part of a complex sensory network that processes tactile information through different sensory modalities: touch, proprioception, temperature, and pain.
- The **sensory information** from these receptors travels via peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and then to the brain, where it is processed to form coherent haptic perceptions.
- This system not only covers the skin but also extends to epithelia, skeletal muscles, bones, joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system, making it comprehensive in scope and function.
