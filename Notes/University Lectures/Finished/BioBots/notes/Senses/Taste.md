>  The gustatory system or the sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor). A few recognized submodalities exist within taste: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. 

Very recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste sub-modality for fats, or lipids.
The sense of taste is often confused with the perception of flavor, which is the results of the multi-modal integration of gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) sensations.
