- A basic evaluation method for measuring the quality of a generated mask is the Intersection over Union (IoU). The IoU, also referred to as Jaccard Index, represents the intersection ratio between the models prediction and the ground truth (GT). 
- The IoU can be calculated using $$J(A,B) = \frac{|A∩B|}{ |A∪B|}$$

- The top diagram shows the intersection of two bounding boxes, which is the area of overlap. The bottom diagram represents the union of the two bounding boxes, which is the total area covered by both boxes. IoU is calculated as the ratio of the intersection area to the union area, and it measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. A higher IoU indicates a more accurate object detection. 
- For object detection it refers to the ratio of the overlap area to the combined area of predicted bounding box and GT bounding box. The ideal scenario for object detection is when the predicted bounding box has an IoU of 1, indicating that the prediction perfectly overlaps the GT. 
- In the case of segmentation, the GT and predicted areas are not necessarily rectangular. It can be of any regular or irregular shape. Therefore, a pixel-by-pixel analysis has to be done: $$IoU =  \frac{TP}{TP+FP+FN},$$where True Positives (TP) are the pixels which are correctly segmented and are therefore in both the predicted and the GT masks. False Positives (FP), on the other hand, are the pixels that are included in the predicted mask but do not exist in the GT mask. Lastly, False Negatives (FN) are the pixels that are present in the GT mask but were incorrectly predicted by the model to be outside of it. 
- However, the IoU metric it is not well-suited for evaluating instance segmentation models, because it only measures the overlap between two sets of pixels
