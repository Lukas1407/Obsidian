Also known as Mendel's laws of inheritance.

## Law of dominance and uniformity
> [!summary] Definition
> Some [[Evolution Nomenclature#Allele|alleles]] are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant [[Evolution Nomenclature#Allele|allele]] will display the effect of the dominant [[Evolution Nomenclature#Allele|allele]]. 

- If two parents are mated with each other who differ in one genetic characteristic for which they are both homozygous (each pure-bred)
-  All offspring in the first generation (F1) are equal and show the dominant trait. 

## Law of segregation
> [!summary] Definition
> During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate from each other so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.

- When two individuals, both heterozygous for a certain trait are crossed. 
- For example, hybrids of the F1-generation. 
- The offspring in the F2-generation differ in genotype and phenotype so that the characteristics of the grandparents (P-generation) regularly occur again.
- 1/4 are homozygous recessive 
- 2/4 are heterozygous
- 1/4 are homozygous dominant 

## Law of independent assortment
> [!summary] Definition
> Genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes. 

- Alleles for separate traits are passed independently of one another. 
- That is, the biological selection of an allele for one trait has nothing to do with the selection of an allele for any other trait. 
- -> This however is not correct!
