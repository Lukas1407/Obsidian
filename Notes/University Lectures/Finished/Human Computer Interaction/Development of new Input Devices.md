- Humans:
	- Want to use the machine to solve a tasks/problem
	- Almost always have the same "interface", the same [[Natural Senses]]
- Machines:
	- Can solve a lot of tasks faster, better than the human
	- Need instructions on how to do so
- Communication between the 2 is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">on the same path</mark> (same tokens like alphabet) necessary
	- Typing something but the machine only emits sounds is not a good way of interaction
	- The interface between human and computer generally consists of more than the GUI and is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">bidirectional</mark>:

	- The hardware (input) and software (ui) need to fit together!

- Different input devices vary in intuitiveness for the human:

	- Speech is the most intuitive but is also hard for the computer to process and understand

## Keyboard
- Optimized for text input
- Very efficient
	- Familiar
	- Low learning curve but high learning potential
	- Haptic feedback
	- Visual feedback
	- Flexible
### Keyboard Layout
- Assumption: 
	- The QWERTY layout comes from typewrites, where the layout had to be chosen because of constraints in the movement of the arms
	- ![[Pasted image 20240306101403.jpg|200]]
- But: placement of $E$ and $R$ says otherwise -> they would collide and are typed often after one another

- Different layouts:
	- Dvorak or Colemak: Most typed characters are on the homerow
	- -> can improve typing speed but not meaningfully enough that its worth learning
### Problems with Virtual Keyboards
- Do not have haptic feedback
- Little space for each key
- Ideas for improvements:
	- Swype
	- Autocorrect/Autocomplete
	- Make touch area of most likely next key larger

## Mouse 
- Concept existed since 1964 in "The mother of all demos"
- Since then virtually unchanged
- Natural Scrolling (in the same direction the mouse wheel is going) vs Reverse Scrolling:
	- Response-Effect Compatibility: The performance is better if the action correlates with the resulting effect
	- Stimulus-Response Compatibility: The reaction is quicker and more accurate if the action and stimulus have a spatial relationship
