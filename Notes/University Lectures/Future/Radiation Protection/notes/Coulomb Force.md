- The Coulomb force is the electric force between two charged particles.
## Characteristics
### Repulsive for Proton-Proton
- Protons have a positive charge.
- Like charges repel each other according to Coulomb's law.
- The force between two protons is repulsive, pushing them apart.
### Infinite Range
- The Coulomb force diminishes with the square of the distance but never completely vanishes.
- This means the force has an infinite range; it acts over any distance, no matter how large
