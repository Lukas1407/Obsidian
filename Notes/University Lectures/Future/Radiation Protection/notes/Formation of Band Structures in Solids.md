- **Isolated Atom**: Shows discrete energy levels.
- **Small Number of Atoms (N = 2, 4, 8)**: As atoms come together, their energy levels split due to interactions between them. The more atoms there are, the more energy levels split.
- **Large Number of Atoms**: When the number of atoms (N) becomes very large, the discrete energy levels form continuous energy bands.

## Band Structure Formation
- **Band Structure**: This results from the overlap of energy levels in a large array of atoms, leading to the formation of bands where electrons can exist.
- **Band Gap**: The region between the conduction band (higher energy) and the valence band (lower energy) where no electron states exist.
- In a crystal lattice (solid), atoms are in a periodic array.
- The overlapping atomic orbitals lead to the formation of continuous energy bands.
- Electrons can move freely within these bands, which is essential for electrical conductivity in materials.
