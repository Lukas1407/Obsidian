- The nuclear force is the force that holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus.
## Characteristics
### Attractive
- The nuclear force is attractive and acts to bind nucleons (protons and neutrons) together.
- This force is strong enough to overcome the repulsive Coulomb force between protons.
### Independent of Nucleon Type
- The nuclear force acts between all nucleons regardless of whether they are protons or neutrons.
- It does not depend on the charge of the particles, making it different from the Coulomb force.
### Very Short Range
- The effective range of the nuclear force is extremely short, around 2-3 femtometers
- Beyond this range, the force drops off rapidly and becomes negligible.
