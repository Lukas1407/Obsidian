- The Pauli Exclusion Principle Explains the Structure of the Periodic Table
- The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of [[Quantum Number|quantum numbers]].
- Each electron in an atom is described by four [[Quantum Number|quantum numbers]]: principal ($n$), angular momentum ($l$), magnetic ($m_l$​), and spin ($m_s$​).
## Importance
- The exclusion principle explains why electrons fill up orbitals in a specific manner and why each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins.
- It underpins the structure of the periodic table, determining the electron configurations of elements and explaining periodic trends in chemical properties.
