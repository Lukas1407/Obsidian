- **X-axis (R)**: Represents the internuclear separation (distance between the two hydrogen nuclei).
- **Y-axis (Energy)**: Represents the total energy of the H₂ molecule.

- **Antiparallel Electron Spins**: This configuration has lower energy, creating a stable molecule (bonding state).
- **Parallel Electron Spins**: This configuration has higher energy, resulting in a nonbonding state.

- **Key Point (R ≈ 0.74 Å)**: This is the equilibrium bond distance where the energy is minimized, forming a stable H₂ molecule
- In isolated atoms or small molecules, energy levels are discrete.
- In solids, due to the interaction of many atoms, these discrete levels spread out into bands.
