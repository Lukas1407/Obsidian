## $Q$-Value
- The $Q$-value of a nuclear reaction is the energy (mass) difference between the reactants (educts) and the products. It represents the amount of energy released (exothermic reaction) or absorbed (endothermic reaction) in the process.
### Calculation
- The $Q$-value is calculated using the mass difference between the reactants and products, converted to energy using Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence principle $E=m\cdot c^{2}$
- $$Q=(\text{Mass of reactants}-\text{Mass of products})\cdot c^{2}$$
- The masses of electrons and other light particles are often negligible compared to the mass of the nucleus and are sometimes excluded from the calculation.
#### [[Alpha Decay]]
$$Q_{\alpha}=\Delta P - \Delta D - \Delta_{He}$$​
- $\Delta P$: Mass defect of the parent nucleus.
- $\Delta D$: Mass defect of the daughter nucleus.
- $\Delta_{He}$​: Mass defect of the alpha particle.
- This formula calculates the energy released by subtracting the total mass of the products from the mass of the parent nucleus.
#### [[Beta Decay#$ beta {-}$ Decay|Beta⁻-Decay]]
$$Q_{\beta^{-}}=\Delta P - \Delta D$$
- The energy released is the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei.
#### [[Beta Decay#$ beta {+}$ Decay|Beta⁺-Decay]]
$$Q_{\beta^{+}}= \Delta P - \Delta D -2m_{e}c^{2}$$

- $m_{e}$​: Mass of the electron.
- $2m_{e}c^{2}$: Energy equivalent of the mass of two electrons (one for the positron and one for the neutrino).
- The $Q$-value accounts for the mass difference and the energy associated with the positron and neutrino production.
#### [[Gamma Decay]]
$$Q_{\gamma}=\Delta P - \Delta D$$
- The $Q$-value represents the energy difference between the excited and ground states of the nucleus, which is emitted as a gamma photon.
[[Electron Capture (EC)]]
$$Q_{EC}=\Delta P - \Delta D - E_B$$

- $E_{B}$​: Binding energy of the captured electron.
- The $Q$-value includes the mass difference and subtracts the binding energy of the captured electron.

## Energetics
- If the $Q$-value is positive ($Q>0$), energy is released during the reaction. This is common in [[Radioactive Decay|radioactive decay]], where the resulting products are more stable than the initial nucleus.
- If the $Q$-value is negative ($Q<0)$, energy must be supplied for the reaction to occur.
