 > [!abstract] Definition
> Ionizing radiation is a type of energy released by atoms that can remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, thus creating ions. It has enough energy to break chemical bonds, which can cause damage to living tissue. 

- **Types of Ionizing Radiation**: Includes [[Alpha Particles]], [[Beta Particles]], [[Gamma Ray]], and [[Electromagnetic (EM) Waves|X-Rays]].
