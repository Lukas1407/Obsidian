[](Ionizing%20Radiation.md)> [!abstract] Definition
> Radiation is a subset of these electromagnetic waves combined with a class of energetic subatomic particles with very high kinetic energies; these are called [[Ionizing Radiation|ionizing radiation]], and the particles are termed particle radiation. Other sorts of waves, such as acoustic, seismic, hydraulic and so on are not usually considered to be forms of "radiation" in either sense.
