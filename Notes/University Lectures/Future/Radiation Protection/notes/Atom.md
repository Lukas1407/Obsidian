## Orbital Overlap and Chemical Bonding
- Chemical bonds between atoms form when their atomic [[Orbitals|orbitals]] overlap.
- The overlap of [[Orbitals|orbitals]] allows electrons to be shared between atoms, leading to the formation of covalent bonds.
- Orbital overlap theory helps explain the shapes and strengths of different types of chemical bonds.
- It also accounts for the molecular geometries and the spatial arrangement of atoms in molecules, which are crucial for understanding chemical reactivity and properties.
### Indistinguishability of Electrons
- In a chemical bond, electrons are shared between atoms and cannot be distinguished as belonging to one atom or another.
- The wave functions of the electrons overlap, creating a shared region of electron density between the bonded atoms.
- The indistinguishability of electrons leads to the formation of a bond that is best described as a shared electron cloud rather than individual electrons moving between atoms.
