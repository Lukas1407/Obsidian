- Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle with infinite precision.
- Mathematically, this is expressed as:$$ \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$where:
    - $\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position.
    - $\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in momentum.
    - $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.
- This principle implies that the more precisely we know a particle's position, the less precisely we can know its momentum, and vice versa.
- It fundamentally limits the precision with which we can make measurements and describes the inherent uncertainties in quantum systems.
