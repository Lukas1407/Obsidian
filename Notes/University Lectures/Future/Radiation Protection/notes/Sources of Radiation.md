## [[X-Ray Tube]]
### Principle
-  **Deceleration of Accelerated Electrons**: Electrons are accelerated towards a metal target. When they collide with the target, they rapidly decelerate, causing the emission of X-rays.
- **Process**: Known as Bremsstrahlung, where the high-energy electrons lose energy in the form of X-ray photons upon hitting the target material.
### Radiation
- **X-Rays**: High-energy electromagnetic radiation used in medical imaging and material analysis.
## Accelerator
- Electrostatic: Uses static electric fields to accelerate charged particles.
- Example: Van de Graaff Accelerator.
### Principle
- **Voltage Accelerates Charged Particles**: Charged particles such as electrons or ions are accelerated by a potential difference, gaining kinetic energy.
