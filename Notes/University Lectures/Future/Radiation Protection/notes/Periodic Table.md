- [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]]

## Structure
- Elements are arranged in order of increasing [[Atom Notation|atomic number]].
- The structure of the periodic table reflects the filling of electron shells and sub-shells, as governed by the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]]
- Elements in the same group have similar valence electron configurations, leading to similar chemical properties.
