>  A confidence bound, also known as a confidence limit, is part of a confidence interval in statistics. It represents either the lower or upper end of the range of values within which you can expect to find the true value of a parameter with a certain level of confidence. For example, if you have a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a dataset, the confidence bounds are the two numbers that define the intervalâ€™s limits, within which you would expect the true mean to lie 95% of the time if you were to repeat the experiment or sampling process
