The goal of RL is to learn a good sequence of actions
- Repeated interaction with the world 
- There is an optimality criterion
-  No (or limited) knowledge how the world works

Examples of RL:
- Beat the Backgammon Champion
- Grasping of Objects
-  Control of Power-Plants
- Management of a Portfolios

Basic reinforcement learning is modeled as a [[Markov Decision Process]].
