### Movements

1. **Fundamental Terminology**:
   - Movements in the ankle and foot are described in relation to three standard axes of rotation: sagittal, frontal, and transverse.
   - **Sagittal Plane**: Movement perpendicular to this axis involves dorsiflexion (lifting the foot upwards towards the shin) and plantarflexion (pointing the toes downward).
   - **Frontal Plane**: Movement perpendicular to this axis involves inversion (turning the sole of the foot inward) and eversion (turning the sole outward).
   - **Transverse Plane**: Rotational movements around the vertical axis.
2. **Applied Terminology**:
   - Refers to movements perpendicular to an oblique axis of rotation, which accounts for the combined and interdependent movements typical in the foot, such as those seen in walking or running.
### Bones and Joints

1. **Talocrural Joint (Ankle Joint)**:
   - A hinge joint formed by the tibia, fibula, and talus.
   - Allows primarily for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.
2. **Subtalar Joint**:
   - Located between the talus and the calcaneus (heel bone).
   - Allows for inversion and eversion of the foot.
3. **Transverse Tarsal Joint**:
   - A combined joint involving the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints.
   - Contributes to the complex movements of the foot, assisting in adapting to various surfaces by permitting a combination of twisting and bending motions.
### Ligaments

- **Lateral Ankle Ligaments**:
  - **Anterior Talofibular Ligament**: Prevents forward sliding of the talus.
  - **Calcaneofibular Ligament**: Stabilizes the lateral aspect of the subtalar joint.
  - **Posterior Talofibular Ligament**: Prevents backward displacement of the talus.
- **Medial (Deltoid) Ligaments**:
  - Strong ligaments that support the medial side of the ankle, preventing excessive eversion.
- **Tibio-fibular Ligaments**:
  - Stabilize the connection between the tibia and fibula at the ankle.
### Muscles and Torque
- **Muscular Control**:
  - **Dorsiflexors**: Muscles like the tibialis anterior, which lift the foot upwards. Produce a torque of about 55 Nm.
  - **Plantar Flexors**: Muscles including the gastrocnemius and soleus, which point the toes downward and support the body's weight, generating a torque of about 105 Nm.
- **EMG Signal Generation**:
  - Muscles of the ankle are often used in electromyography (EMG) for controlling ankle/foot prostheses, particularly the dorsiflexors, to provide natural movement patterns for the prosthetic user.
