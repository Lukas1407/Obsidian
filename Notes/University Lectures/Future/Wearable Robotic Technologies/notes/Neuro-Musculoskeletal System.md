> [!abstract] Definition
> The neuro-musculoskeletal system is an intricate framework combining the nervous system and the muscular system to control human movement. 

This system integrates:
- **656 muscles** in the human body, which play pivotal roles in movement and stability.
- **Nervous system**, including the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), which controls and coordinates muscle activity.
## Functions of the Neuro-Musculoskeletal System
1. **Force Exertion**:
   - Muscles generate forces necessary for all types of physical actions, from simple movements like walking to complex, coordinated activities like playing sports.
2. **Position Maintenance**:
   - Muscles help maintain posture and hold positions, whether static (like standing) or dynamic (like maintaining balance while moving).
3. **Joint Stabilization**:
   - By surrounding and supporting joints, muscles stabilize them, preventing unwanted movements and protecting against injuries.
## Coordination of Muscle Action
- Each muscle fiber receives innervation from a specific branch of the nervous system, ensuring precise control and coordination of muscle actions.
- The nervous system monitors and adjusts the force, length, and speed of muscle contractions, optimizing the body's mechanical efficiency and responsiveness.
