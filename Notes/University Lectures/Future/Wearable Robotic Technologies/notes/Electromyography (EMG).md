The Electromyography (EMG) chart you're referring to illustrates the activity of different leg muscles throughout a gait cycle. EMG is a technique used to measure the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles, indicating how active muscles are during different phases of movement. Let's explore the main muscle groups involved in the gait, specifically in the sagittal plane (the plane that divides the body into left and right halves), as they relate to the movements of the hip, knee, and ankle joints.

## Main Muscle Groups Involved in Gait:
1. **Hip Joint**:
   - **Flexors (Iliopsoas)**: These muscles primarily act during the initial swing phase to lift the leg. In the chart, this corresponds to the increase in activity at the beginning of the swing phase.
   - **Extensors (Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus)**: These muscles are active during the late stance phase to extend the hip and propel the body forward. In the chart, you would see their activity peaking towards the end of the stance phase, helping to push off the ground.
2. **Knee Joint**:
   - **Flexors (Hamstrings)**: Also serving as hip extensors, the hamstrings flex the knee at the beginning of the swing phase, allowing the leg to clear the ground.
   - **Extensors (Quadriceps - Vasti and Rectus Femoris)**: These muscles stabilize the knee upon landing and extend the knee during the mid-stance phase to support the body's weight.
3. **Ankle Joint**:
   - **Dorsiflexors (Tibialis Anterior)**: This muscle prevents the toes from dragging during swing phase by lifting the foot. It's active right before and during the initial contact to prepare the foot for ground contact.
   - **Plantarflexors (Triceps Surae - Gastrocnemius and Soleus)**: These muscles propel the body forward at the end of the stance phase. They are most active just before the toe-off, providing the necessary force to push off from the ground.
## EMG Signal Analysis Across the Gait Cycle:

- **0% to 60% (Stance Phase)**:
  - Early stance (0-10%): Activity in plantarflexors to stabilize the ankle, and in quadriceps to support the knee.
  - Mid to late stance (10-60%): Increasing activity in hip extensors and plantarflexors to prepare for push-off.
- **60% to 100% (Swing Phase)**:
  - Early swing (60-80%): A spike in dorsiflexors to clear the foot and in hip flexors to advance the leg.
  - Late swing (80-100%): Hamstrings prepare to decelerate the leg for the next stance phase, and quadriceps activate slightly to prepare the knee for landing.

The EMG signals provide quantitative data that reflect the coordination and timing of muscle activations necessary for efficient gait. This information is crucial for diagnosing and treating gait abnormalities, designing rehabilitation programs, and optimizing the functionality of assistive devices like prosthetics and orthotics.
