Prosthetic hands are designed to replace the function and appearance of missing hands, with different types depending on the needs and preferences of the user. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at the three main types of prosthetic hands:
### 1. Cosmetic Hands
- **Purpose**: Primarily aesthetic; designed to mimic the appearance of a real hand.
- **Functionality**: Limited to non-functional; they do not have movable parts but might assist in passive tasks such as stabilizing or holding objects down.
- **Usage**: Often chosen by patients for daily use to blend the appearance of the prosthetic with their natural body image, especially in social or professional settings.
### 2. Body Powered Prosthetic Hands
- **Mechanism**: Operated mechanically through a system involving a harness and cable. Movement in the shoulder or another part of the body is used to control the hand.
- **Design**: Common designs include a hook or more anthropomorphic hands that look like human hands. The hook design is particularly noted for its durability and functionality.
- **Functionality**: These prosthetics allow the user to perform active tasks such as gripping and holding objects. The harness system typically operates a cable that opens and closes the prosthetic hand or hook.
- **Advantages**: Body-powered prosthetics are durable, reliable, and typically lighter than myoelectric hands. They are also generally less expensive and easier to maintain.
### 3. Myoelectric Hands
- **Mechanism**: These prosthetics use electrical signals from the user's residual limb muscles to control the movements of the hand via motors.
- **Power**: Operated by batteries, allowing for more complex and refined movements compared to body-powered prosthetics.
- **Functionality**: Capable of multiple degrees of freedom in movement, including individual finger articulation, depending on the sophistication of the design.
- **Usage**: Myoelectric hands are considered the most advanced type of prosthetic hand in terms of technology and functionality, offering the closest mimicry to natural hand movements.
#### General Drawbacks of Myoelectric Hands
- **Cost:** High initial purchase price and ongoing maintenance expenses.
- **Complexity in Repair:** Often require specialized knowledge or parts to repair, which can be a significant hurdle for users.
- **Weight:** A common complaint among users, with many finding the prosthetics too heavy, which can lead to discomfort and reduced usage.
- **Grasping Force:** Generally, myoelectric hands do not provide enough force for handling heavy objects, which limits their functionality.
## Interfaces and Controll
Myoelectric prosthetic hands are advanced devices that use electrical signals generated by the user's muscles to control their movements. Here's a breakdown of how these systems work, focusing on the different interfaces and control mechanisms available:
### Myoelectric Control Basics
- **Myoelectric Control**: Utilizes the electrical activity produced by muscles (electromyography or EMG) to control the movements of a prosthetic hand. The intensity and pattern of the EMG signals are converted into actions performed by the prosthetic.
### Types of Myoelectric Interfaces
#### **Surface Electrodes**:
   - **Placement**: Attached to the skin over the remaining muscles of the amputated limb.
   - **Function**: Capture EMG signals through the skin.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Non-invasive, no surgery required.
     - Easy to fit and adjust.
   - **Drawbacks**:
     - Limited by the quality of the skin contact; can be affected by factors like sweating or movement of the electrodes.
     - Typically used to control a single degree of freedom (DoF), such as opening and closing the hand. More complex controls can be challenging and less intuitive due to the simplicity of the signal processing.
#### **Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR)**:
**TMR** is a surgical procedure that reassigns nerves that previously controlled the amputated limb to different, intact muscles. This technique is often used for individuals who have undergone upper arm or shoulder amputations.

   - **Process**: A surgical technique where nerves that previously controlled the amputated limb are redirected to remaining muscle sites.
   - **Function**: After reinnervation, the muscles produce clearer EMG signals when the brain sends commands originally intended for the amputated limb, enhancing control over the prosthetic.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Provides stronger, more distinct EMG signals.
     - Allows for more intuitive control of the prosthetic with multiple degrees of freedom.
     - **Signal Amplification:** The reinnervated muscle amplifies the nerve signals, which can then be detected by surface electrodes.
	- **Intuitive Control:** Patients can control their prosthetic limbs more intuitively. The muscle movements corresponding to the original limb's actions produce distinct EMG signals.
	- **Multiple Controls:** Allows for the control of multiple functions of the prosthetic simultaneously due to the generation of multiple independent EMG signals.
	- **Sensory Feedback:** Some sensory feedback is possible through the transferred nerves, enhancing the user's experience and control.
   - **Drawbacks**:
     - Requires surgery but does not involve direct implantation into nerves or muscles.
     - **Surgical Risks:** The procedure requires surgery, which comes with inherent risks such as infection or potential paralysis of the target muscle.
	- **Longevity of Nerve Transfers:** There's uncertainty about the long-term survival of the transferred nerves.
#### **Implanted EMG Electrodes** (Research only):
   - **Implementation**: Electrodes are surgically implanted directly into the muscles.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Produces very reliable and strong EMG signals.
     - Allows for precise control over more complex prosthetic hands.
     - **Higher Resolution Control:** Capable of distinguishing signals from more muscles, providing more degrees of freedom for controlling the prosthetic.
	- **Stable Signals:** Unlike surface electrodes, implanted electrodes deliver consistent signals over time, unaffected by external factors like skin condition.
   - **Drawbacks**:
     - Invasive procedure requiring surgery.
     - Long-term viability and stability of the implants can be a concern.
     - **Surgical Requirements:** Implantation is invasive, requiring surgery to place electrodes directly on the muscles.
	- **Biocompatibility Issues:** There may be complications related to the body's response to foreign objects, affecting the longevity and functionality of the implants.
#### **Advanced Neural and Brain Control Techniques**:
##### **Nerve Control**: 
- Electrodes are connected directly to the nerves, potentially allowing for very refined control that mimics natural hand movements.
- **Advantages:**
	- **Highly Detailed Control:** These methods could potentially tap directly into the neurological or brain signals that originally controlled the limb, offering a natural and precise control system.
	- **Complete Information:** Nerve and brain signals contain comprehensive data needed for full hand movement control.
- **Drawbacks:**
	- **Biocompatibility and Durability:** Similar to implanted electrodes, devices that interface directly with nerves or brain tissue face issues from tissue responses that can degrade signal quality over time.
	- **Complexity and Feasibility:** These technologies are still in developmental stages and are not yet viable for commercial use due to their complexity and the high level of precision required in the signal interpretation and hardware design.
##### **Brain EEG Control**: 
- Involves picking up signals directly from the brain via EEG to control the prosthetic, aiming for a direct brain-interface.
   - **Advantages**:
     - High potential for achieving natural-like control and multiple degrees of freedom.
   - **Drawbacks**:
     - Highly experimental and complex.
     - Requires significant technological and medical infrastructure.
### Research Hands vs. Commercial Hands
**Prototype Hands:**
- **Purpose:** Designed to showcase specific features or explore new technologies, not necessarily to function as complete, market-ready prosthetic devices.
- **Comparison Challenges:** Due to their experimental nature, prototype hands can vary greatly in form, function, and efficiency, making direct comparisons with commercial hands difficult.
**Commercial Hands:**
- **Weight:** Typically range from 350 to 615 grams, designed to balance functionality with wearability.
- **Practicality and Usability:** More focused on user needs such as durability, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness.
**Research-Based Hands:**
- **Weight:** Can be significantly heavier, ranging up to 2200 grams, as they often incorporate additional technologies or features that are not yet optimized for everyday use.
- **Focus:** Aim to push the boundaries of what's possible rather than immediate practical application.
