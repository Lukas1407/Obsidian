The dynamic model builds on the kinematic model by adding forces and torques, making it a more comprehensive representation that includes the properties of motion and energy.

- **Properties of Segments**:
    - **Mass**: The weight distribution of each segment, which affects how forces and torques are applied.
    - **Length**: As noted in the kinematic model, but crucial here for calculating the dynamics.
    - **Center of Mass**: The point at which the mass of a segment can be considered to be concentrated.
    - **Moment of Inertia Tensor**: This tensor describes how the mass is distributed relative to the center of mass and affects the segment's resistance to rotational motion about various axes.
