The discussion about **Actuation Synergies** and the **Implementation of Underactuation** in hand exoskeletons delves into the biomechanical and robotic implications of human hand anatomy, specifically focusing on how tendon configurations enhance grasping capabilities and how these concepts can be translated into robotic systems like exoskeletons.

### Actuation Synergies
This concept explores the optimal structuring of the human hand, particularly the arrangement of tendons that facilitate complex hand movements:
- **Human Hand Anatomy**: The anatomy of the human hand, including the number and arrangement of tendons, plays a crucial role in its versatile grasping capabilities. There is ongoing debate regarding whether the human hand is 'optimized' for grasping and how tendon routing contributes functionally.
- **Tendon Routing and Optimization**: Studies involve quantifying how different configurations of tendon routing affect the precision of grasps. Using computational methods such as smart random searches or Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, researchers can generate and evaluate thousands of finger designs. These studies often focus on optimizing factors like the number of tendons, their routing, and joint centers of rotation.
- **Results**: Optimizations suggest that non-symmetric and carefully tailored tendon routings can significantly enhance the grasping capabilities of synthetic systems, sometimes surpassing human performance by a substantial margin.
