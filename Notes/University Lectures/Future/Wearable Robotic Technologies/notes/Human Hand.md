## Bones and Joints
![[Hand.png#invert|400]]
### Bones of the Hand
- **Carpal Bones**: These are the eight small bones that make up the wrist, forming two rows of four bones each.
- **Metacarpals**: The five bones that form the middle part of the hand.
- **Proximal Phalanges**: The first set of bones directly connected to the metacarpals.
- **Intermediate Phalanges**: The second set of bones (absent in the thumb, which only has two phalanges).
- **Distal Phalanges**: The tips of the fingers.
### Joints and Their Movements
- **Radiocarpal Joint**: A condyloid joint allowing flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction.
- **Thumb Carpometacarpal (CM)**: A saddle joint that allows movements in two planes, making the thumb's gripping and rotating actions possible.
- **Fingers Carpometacarpal (CM)**: Generally, these are gliding joints that allow limited movement, primarily in the form of sliding or twisting.
- **Intermetacarpal Joints**: These also typically function as gliding joints, allowing the bones of the hand a degree of movement relative to each other.
- **Thumb Metacarpophalangeal (MP) and Metacarpophalangeal (MP) Joints**: These are condyloid joints, enabling flexion and extension, as well as some lateral movements.
- **Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) and Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) Joints**: Hinge joints that allow flexion and extension, such as bending and straightening the fingers.
## Finger Dimensions
- **Phalanges Lengths**: The lengths of the phalanges (the bones of the fingers) can vary depending on how they are measured:
  - **Palmar Measurement**: Measured from the palm side.
  - **Dorsal Measurement**: Measured from the back of the hand. This is noted to be closest to the actual bone lengths because it includes less soft tissue in the measurement process.
  - **Bone Measurement**: Direct measurement of the bone, likely through imaging technology like X-ray.
- **Distal Phalanx**: This is the tip of the fingers. The bone of the distal phalanx is shorter than what might be measured from the outside, as the tip includes soft tissue not accounted for in bone-only measurements.
## Muscular System of the Wrist
This part of the explanation details the muscles that control wrist movements and contribute to hand movements. Understanding this is critical for fields such as orthopedics, rehabilitation, and prosthetic design.
- **Principal Wrist Flexor Muscles**:
  - **Flexor Carpi Radialis**: Flexes and abducts the wrist.
  - **Flexor Carpi Ulnaris**: Flexes and adducts the wrist.
- **Principal Wrist Extensor Muscles**:
  - **Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus**: Extends the wrist and aids in its abduction.
  - **Extensor Carpi Ulnaris**: Extends and adducts the wrist.
  - **Extensor Digitorum**: Extends the fingers and the wrist.
- **Muscle Actions**:
  - The combination of these extensors and flexors allows for **radial/ulnar deviation**:
    - **Radial Deviation**: Movement of the wrist towards the thumb side.
    - **Ulnar Deviation**: Movement of the wrist towards the little finger side.
  - These muscles are also key in generating electromyography (EMG) signals used to control devices such as hand prostheses.

- Large number of muscles are responsible for the precise movements performed by the hand and fingers:
  - **Extrinsic Muscles**: Nine muscles that cross the wrist; these have one attachment in the forearm and another in the hand.
  - **Intrinsic Muscles**: Ten muscles located entirely within the hand.
- **Strength and Force Comparisons**:
  - **Flexor Muscles**: Generally the strongest.
  - **Extension Force**: Is 38% of the flexion force.
  - **Abduction Force**: Is 98% of the flexion force, indicating high efficiency.
  - **Adduction Force**: Is 79% of the flexion force.
## [[Tendon]] Routing and Kinematic Structure

### [[Tendon]] Routing
- The routing of these tendons is critical for proper joint articulation and finger positioning. For example, the flexor tendons, which run along the palmar side, enable finger curling, while extensor tendons on the dorsal side straighten the fingers.
### Kinematic Structure
- The kinematic structure of the hand involves the mechanical arrangement of joints, bones, and tendons, allowing for motion.
- **Hinge Joints**: Typically, hinge joints like those in the fingers (Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) and Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joints) allow movement in one plane, primarily flexion and extension. However, in the hand, these joints also exhibit some sliding motion, which means they are not purely rotational. This sliding is due to the shape of the joint surfaces and the elastic nature of the surrounding tissues, providing a small degree of translational movement along with rotation.
- This hybrid movement (rotational with a bit of sliding) adds a layer of complexity to finger motion and is a factor in the dexterity and the range of motion of the fingers.
## Finger Trajectories
### Workspace of the Fingertips
- The workspace of the fingertips refers to the three-dimensional volume of space that the fingertips can reach when the wrist and arm are kept static.
- Observations indicate that this workspace generally has a **spiral shape**. This means that as fingers move through their operational range, they trace a spiral path. This path is a result of the combined movements of all the joints in the fingers and the coordinated action of muscles and tendons.

### Orientation and Force Capabilities
- The orientation of the fingertips, and therefore their ability to apply force, varies significantly across their workspace. Depending on the finger's position within its spiral trajectory, the angle at which force can be applied changes.
- These variations affect how effectively force can be exerted in different directions, influencing tasks such as gripping, manipulating objects, or performing fine motor skills. The anatomical and biomechanical setup allows the fingers to adapt their orientation to optimize interaction with objects within their environment.
