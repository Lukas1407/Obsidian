- **Master Motor Map** sits at the center, acting as a hub that connects various inputs and outputs related to human motion analysis.
- **Inputs**:
    - **Markerless and Marker-based Motion Capture**: Techniques that capture human movement data, which can be processed to feed into the MMM.
    - **Motion Capture Dynamic Data**: Includes force data and other dynamics measurements.
- **Outputs/Conversions**:
    - The data processed through MMM can be converted for use with various robots (Robot A, Robot B, etc.), rendered for visualization, or used for further motion analysis and action recognition.
## Overview
The MMM serves as a comprehensive reference model that includes several aspects of human anatomy and motion dynamics:
- **[[Kinematic Model]]**: Describes the motion of points, bodies, or systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause them. It focuses on joint angles and limb movements.
- **[[Dynamic Model]]**: Deals with forces and torques and their effect on motion. It includes the physics of movement.
- **[[Statistic Anthropomorphic Model]]**: Incorporates statistical and anthropometric data about body proportions and variations across populations.
## Applications
- **For Humanoid Robot Design**: MMM provides a detailed human body model which helps in designing robots that can mimic human actions accurately.
- **Imitation of Human Actions**: It enables robots to replicate human movements in a realistic and physically accurate manner.
- **Action Recognition**: Assists in identifying human actions, which is crucial for interactive robots.
- **Visualization of Human Movements**: Offers tools for the detailed visual representation of human motions, improving understanding and design of interfaces.
