> [!abstract] Definition
> The shoulder joint is often considered the most complex joint in the human body due to its structure and the range of motion it allows. It comprises several articulations and is supported by numerous muscles. 

## Key Components
- It consists of 5 separate articulations and 18 muscles
### Articulations of the Shoulder

1. **Glenohumeral Joint**:
    - **Type**: Ball-and-socket joint.
    - **Bones Involved**: The head of the humerus (upper arm bone) and the glenoid cavity of the scapula (shoulder blade).
    - **Function**: This is the major shoulder joint, allowing for a wide range of movements including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and rotation. It is primarily responsible for the arm's circular motion and is the most mobile joint in the body.
2. **Sternoclavicular Joint**:
    - **Type**: Saddle-type joint.
    - **Bones Involved**: The sternum (breastbone) and the clavicle (collarbone).
    - **Function**: Acts as the major axis of rotation for the clavicle and indirectly for the scapula, facilitating movements such as shrugging and elevating the arms above the head. It is essential for upper limb mobility, particularly in actions like swimming.
3. **Acromioclavicular Joint**:
    - **Type**: Plane-type synovial joint.
    - **Bones Involved**: The acromion (a bony process on the scapula) and the distal clavicle.
    - **Function**: Allows limited motion primarily in the anterior-posterior direction but contributes to the overall flexibility of the shoulder girdle.
4. **Coracoclavicular Joint**:
    - **Type**: Syndesmosis joint (a fibrous joint where bones are joined together by connective tissue).
    - **Bones Involved**: The coracoid process of the scapula and the clavicle.
    - **Function**: Provides stability to the shoulder by holding the clavicle in place, allowing very little movement.
5. **Scapulothoracic Joint**:
    - **Type**: Not a true synovial joint as there is no joint cavity. This joint represents the interaction between the scapula and the thoracic rib cage.
    - **Function**: Facilitates the smooth gliding of the scapula on the thoracic wall and plays a critical role in positioning the glenohumeral joint properly for various movements. It is crucial for stabilizing the shoulder and enabling the lifting motion of the arm.
### Muscular System and Movement

- The **Serratus Anterior Muscle**, one of the major muscles illustrated in your diagram, is pivotal in pulling the scapula forward and around the rib cage, which is essential for raising the arms.
- The **Coracoclavicular Ligament**, a key stabilizing feature, gets stretched during shoulder movements, ensuring the clavicle's positioning relative to the scapula.
- Movement of the scapula, such as its upward rotation, is crucial for enabling the arm to raise above the head, which is facilitated by the combined action of the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints.
