They refer to different ways joints and limbs can move relative to the body's planes.
## Abduction and Adduction
- **Plane:** Frontal Plane
- **Axis:** Rotation axis perpendicular to the frontal plane
- **Movement:**
    - **Abduction** is the movement of a limb or other part away from the midline of the body, or from another part.
    - **Adduction** is the movement towards the midline of the body or towards another part.
- **Special Case:**
    - When referring to the spine, these movements along the central axis are termed **lateral flexion**, which involves bending the spine to either side.

## Flexion and Extension
- **Plane:** Sagittal Plane
- **Axis:** Rotation axis perpendicular to the sagittal plane
- **Movement:**
    - **Flexion** decreases the angle between two bones at a joint, like bending the elbow or knee.
    - **Extension** increases the angle, straightening the joint.

## Pronation and Supination / Medial and Lateral Rotation
- **Plane:** Transverse Plane
- **Axis:** Rotation axis perpendicular to the transverse plane
- **Movement:**
    - **Pronation** and **Supination**:
        - For the forearm and hands, pronation turns the hand so the palm faces downwards; supination turns the hand so the palm faces upwards.
        - For the feet, pronation involves a combination of dorsiflexion, eversion, and abduction, while supination involves plantar flexion, inversion, and adduction.
    - **Medial (Internal) Rotation** and **Lateral (External) Rotation**:
        - These movements involve rotating a limb or section (such as the torso, neck, arms, legs) towards (medial) or away (lateral) from the center of the body.

## Combined Movements
- **Circumduction**: This is a circular movement that combines flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. Itâ€™s like drawing a circle in the air with your finger, arm, or leg.
- **Horizontal Flexion/Extension**:
    - Begins from an abducted position and involves moving the limb forward and backward along the horizontal plane.
