### CAREX: Cable-Driven Arm Exoskeleton

**Design and Functionality:**

- **Cable-Driven Mechanism**: CAREX utilizes a lightweight, cable-driven system to actuate arm movements. This design choice results in lower moving inertia and a larger workspace compared to traditional rigid link systems. Cables replace the rigid components, significantly reducing the weight.
- **Configuration**: It features 5 degrees of freedom (DOF)â€”three in the shoulder, one for elbow flexion/extension, and one for forearm supination/pronation.
- **Support Structure**: The exoskeleton includes three cuffs (shoulder, upper arm, and forearm) that are strategically placed on the arm. Seven cables are routed through these cuffs to drive the arm movements.

**Sensing and Actuation:**

- **Sensors**: Encoders are attached to each joint to measure angles, and load cells are used to gauge the tension in each cable at its termination point on the cuff.
- **Actuators**: It employs AC motors capable of delivering a continuous torque of 2.7 Nm, allowing for precise and responsive movement control.

**Workspace Optimization:**

- CAREX is optimized to assist users in performing ADLs. The workspace optimization involved discretizing the target workspace into 7776 configurations and enhancing the number of feasible configurations from 5.6% before optimization to 74.5% after.

**Advantages:**

- The total weight of CAREX is only 1.55 kg, making it much lighter than many existing arm exoskeletons. This minimal weight does not restrict the natural DOF of the human arm and allows for extensive adaptability and comfort.
