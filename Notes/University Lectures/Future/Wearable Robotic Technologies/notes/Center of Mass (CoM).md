> [!abstract] Definition
> The Center of Mass is a critical concept in understanding the biomechanics of walking. It is the point where the total mass of the body is considered to be concentrated when analyzing movement and balance. 

- The CoM plays a vital role in maintaining stability. It is the weighted sum of all body masses at any given configuration, acting as the balance point around which the body stabilizes itself during movement.
