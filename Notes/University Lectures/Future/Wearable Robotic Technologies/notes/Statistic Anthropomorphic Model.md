This model uses statistical data to relate body segment properties to easily measurable characteristics like height and weight. It's particularly useful for creating personalized or population-specific models.

- **Function and Application**:
    - **Regression Models**: Body segment properties (e.g., length, mass) are expressed as functions of global parameters (like body height and weight). This approach is grounded in extensive research and allows models to be adjusted based on a few measurements.
    - **Research Foundations**: The models are based on findings from researchers like de Leva (1996), Winter (2005), and Pronost et al. (2006), who have documented the relationships between various body metrics and segment properties.
