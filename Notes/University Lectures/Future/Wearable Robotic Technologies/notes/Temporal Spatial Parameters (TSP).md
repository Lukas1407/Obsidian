> Temporal Spatial Parameters (TSP) are critical measurements used to analyze the gait cycle. They provide quantitative data on the timing and spatial characteristics of walking, such as step length, stride length, cadence, and the duration of various phases of the gait cycle (e.g., stance, swing, double support). 

## Key Applications of TSP:
1. **Normalization**: TSP are used to normalize gait data so that comparisons can be made across individuals walking at different speeds. This is crucial in clinical and research settings to ensure that differences observed are due to gait characteristics rather than walking speed.
2. **Monitoring**: TSP can be used to monitor the effectiveness of therapies or interventions. By observing changes in these parameters over time, clinicians can assess whether a treatment is improving a patient's gait efficiency and overall mobility.
3. **Performance Measure**: These parameters help assess a patient’s level of disability or recovery progress. Changes in TSP can indicate improvements or deteriorations in a patient’s ability to walk independently and safely.
4. **Screening**: TSP are used to assess the risk of falling, especially in elderly individuals. Parameters like the variability of step time and length can indicate increased instability and a higher risk of falls.
## Exoskeletons and TSP:
- TSP are particularly important in the context of assistive devices like exoskeletons. They help determine how the use of an exoskeleton affects a person's natural walking pattern. By comparing TSP with and without the device, researchers can evaluate if the exoskeleton supports more natural movement patterns or introduces abnormal gait mechanics.
## Variability in TSP Measurement:
- **Inter-subject Variability**: Differences in TSP among different individuals in a study, which can reflect natural diversity in gait patterns.
- **Intra-subject Variability**: Variability in the same individual’s gait over time, which can indicate changes due to fatigue, adaptation, or health status.
- **Inter-session Variability**: Changes in TSP observed during different sessions, potentially influenced by time of day, mood, or other external factors.
- **Intra-session Variability**: Variability observed within the same testing session, which should ideally be minimal unless intentionally introduced by varying test conditions.
