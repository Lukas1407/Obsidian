The human hip is a key structure in maintaining mobility and supporting the body's weight. It is highly adaptable, capable of handling substantial forces during various activities. 
### Movements and Planes

   - **Sagittal Plane**: Includes flexion and extension. Flexion (forward movement of the thigh) is typically about 120°-125°, as seen in high-knee lifts, while extension (backward movement of the thigh) ranges around 10°-15° past the vertical line.
   - **Frontal Plane**: Includes abduction (movement of the leg away from the midline, up to about 45° as in side leg lifts) and adduction (movement toward the body's midline, up to about 30°).
   - **Transverse Plane**: Includes internal and external rotation. The hip can rotate internally and externally about 50° in each direction.
### Bones and Joints

   - The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint, formed by the femoral head (ball) and the acetabulum of the pelvis (socket), which includes parts of the ilium, pubis, and ischium bones.
   - **Three-Dimensional Movement**: The spherical shape of the femoral head allows for extensive movement in multiple directions, though this movement is naturally restricted by the joint's ligaments and the depth of the socket to prevent dislocation.
### Forces

1. **Major Weight-Bearing Joint**:
   - The hip joint is crucial in bearing the body’s weight and absorbing the forces associated with motion, particularly during bipedal activities such as walking, running, and jumping.
2. **Force Distribution During Various Activities**:
   - **Standing Upright**: The reaction force (R) is about 30% of body weight (BW).
   - **Swing Phase of Walking**: As the leg moves forward, the force can rise to about 85% BW.
   - **Support Phase of Walking**: When the foot is on the ground bearing weight, it increases to about 238% BW.
   - **Descending Stairs**: The force spikes to about 260% BW due to the impact and need to control descent.
   - **Cross Country Skiing**: Has higher demands at 460% BW due to dynamic motion and resistance.
   - **Running and Alpine Skiing**: Can reach 520% and up to 780% BW, respectively, under high-speed and high-impact conditions.
3. **Tension in Hip Abductor Muscles**:
   - The hip abductors play a key role in stabilizing the pelvis, especially during the stance phase of gait. The tension in these muscles helps counteract the gravitational pull and the reaction forces from the ground, supporting the body and maintaining balance.
4. **Reaction Force (R)**:
   - This is the force exerted by the ground back against the foot during walking, running, or other activities, directly influencing the loads experienced by the hip joint.
