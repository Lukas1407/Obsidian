The human spine is a complex, vital structure that supports the body, allows a wide range of movement, and protects the spinal cord. It's composed of 33 vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and several joints that facilitate movement. L
## Structure

1. **Vertebrae**:
   - The spine consists of 33 vertebrae, segmented into several regions: 7 cervical (neck), 12 thoracic (mid-back), 5 lumbar (lower back), 5 fused sacral (base of the spine), and 4 fused coccygeal (tailbone) vertebrae.
   - The sacral and coccygeal vertebrae are fused to form the sacrum and the coccyx, respectively, providing stability and weight-bearing support.

2. **Intervertebral Discs**:
   - Each disc is composed of an outer ring, the **annulus fibrosus**, and a central gel-like core, the **nucleus pulposus**.
   - **Function**: These discs serve as shock absorbers between the vertebrae. They resist compressive and torsional (twisting) forces and distribute stress across the spine.
   - **Behavior Under Load**: Intervertebral discs are flexible under low loads but become stiffer under high loads. Mechanically, they act like coil springs that join vertebrae, while the nucleus acts like a ball bearing, facilitating the rolling movement of vertebrae during flexion and extension.
   - **Daily Changes**: Throughout the day, these discs can change in size due to fluid exchange, resulting in a person's height being up to 15 mm to 25 mm shorter by day's end.

### Movements of the Spine and the Trunk
![[spine.png#invert|400]]
1. **Flexion and Extension**:
   - These are primarily movements of bending forward (flexion) and bending backward (extension).
   - **Location**: Most prominent in the cervical and lumbar regions due to their greater flexibility. The thoracic spine is less flexible due to the attachment of the rib cage, which restricts movement.
2. **Lateral Flexion**:
   - This involves bending to the sides.
   - **Location**: More pronounced in the cervical region and less in the thoracic and lumbar regions.
3. **Axial Rotation (Twisting)**:
   - This movement involves turning the face and upper body side to side.
   - **Range of Motion (RoM)**: Up to 12° between cervical vertebrae, about 9° in thoracic vertebrae, decreasing in lower vertebrae, with T7-T8 having about 2° of rotation.
### The Neck

1. **Atlanto-occipital Joint**:
   - **Location**: Between the occipital bone of the skull and the first cervical vertebra (C1, or atlas).
   - **Movement**: Allows for nodding movements (flexion-extension) up to 15°. It does not permit lateral flexion or axial rotation.
2. **Atlanto-axial Joint**:
   - **Location**: Between the first and second cervical vertebrae (C1, atlas, and C2, axis).
   - **Movement**: This joint allows for 75° of axial rotation (which contributes significantly to the head's ability to turn from side to side), 14° of extension, and 24° of lateral flexion.
## Kinematics
### Kinematics of the Craniocervical Joints
1. **Sliding Rotation of the Cervical Vertebrae**:
   - This refers to the movement where the cervical vertebrae rotate over each other, combined with a slight translational (sliding) motion. This unique movement allows for a greater range of motion while maintaining stability in the neck.

2. **Rolling Motion of the Occipital Bone and Vertical Sliding of the Cervical Vertebrae**:
   - The occipital bone (at the base of the skull) interacts with the first cervical vertebra (atlas) in a motion that involves both rolling (rotation around a point) and sliding (movement along a plane). This complex motion facilitates nodding and rotation of the head while the vertical sliding helps accommodate these movements smoothly.

### Kinematics of Thoracolumbar Lateral Flexion
![[Pasted image 20240709113640.png#invert|400]]
1. **Orientation of Facet Surfaces**:
   - In the thoracic region, facet surfaces of the vertebrae are oriented in a direction that is slightly inferior (downwards) and superior (upwards), aiding in stability and rotational limits.
   - In the lumbar region, these surfaces are oriented more laterally (towards the side) and medially (towards the midline), allowing for flexibility in lateral bending and limited rotation.
2. **Intertransverse Ligaments**:
   - These ligaments extend between the transverse processes of adjacent vertebrae. During lateral flexion, they experience stretching, which contributes to the sliding motion of the facet joints, enhancing lateral movement while providing necessary stability.
## Loads on the Spine
1. **Support by Back Muscles**:
   - The back muscles play a crucial role in supporting the spine by generating forces that counteract the effects of gravity and external loads.
   2. **Torque Produced by Body Weights and External Load**:
   - Torque on the spine is produced by the forces due to the body's segments (like the head, trunk, and arms) and any external load being carried or lifted.
   - For example, the diagram shows the calculation of torque at the L5/S1 vertebral joint, where torque is calculated by the formula $T = (Force \times Distance)$. Each segment of the body, including an externally held object, contributes to the overall torque based on its weight and distance from the pivot point (spine).

3. **Advisable Lifting Techniques**:
   - To minimize the torque and thus reduce the stress on the lumbar spine, it is advisable to lift heavy objects close to the trunk. This practice decreases the distance (lever arm) between the load and the spine, thereby reducing the torque.
   - Minimizing trunk flexion during lifting is also recommended to further decrease the torque generated on the spine by the body weight.
