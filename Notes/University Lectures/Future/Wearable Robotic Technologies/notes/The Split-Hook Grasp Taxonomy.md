### 1. Split-Hook Grasp Taxonomy

- **Taxonomy Overview**: The taxonomy classifies the types of grasps that a user can perform with a split-hook prosthetic. It ranges from non-prehensile maneuvers, where the prosthetic does not need to encircle objects completely (e.g., pushing or pulling), to prehensile grips, where the prosthetic needs to wrap around objects to secure them.
- **Grasp Types**:
  - **Non-Prehensile**: Involving contact with the object but not enveloping it fully. Examples include using the tip or the front of the hook.
  - **Prehensile**: Full engagement with the object, involving more secure grips. This includes grips within the fingers of the hook, such as clamp grips and area contacts, which provide greater security and control.
### 2. Force Exertion of Split-Hook

- **External vs. Internal Forces**: The image describes how external and internal forces are applied by the split-hook. External forces include basic actions like pushing, pulling, and lifting, which depend largely on the suspension system and are less cognitively demanding. Internal forces, or gripping actions, require more precision and concentration from the user, influenced by the balance of elastic bands and the control cable.
- **Force Limitation**:
  - **External Forces**: Limited by the hook's mechanical design and how it is suspended from the limb.
  - **Internal Forces (Gripping)**: The gripping actions are restricted by the design elements like elastic bands and the tension of the control cable. These factors affect the precision and security of the grip, requiring increasing levels of user concentration and skill.
### 3. Application in Activities
- **Functional Use**: The diagrams show how the prosthetic hook can be used in various daily activities. The level of force exerted and the type of grasp used can significantly impact the user's ability to perform tasks effectively and comfortably.
### Key Concepts:
- **Grasp Security**: The security of the grip varies with the type of contact the hook makes with objects. More contact points and enveloping grasps provide higher security.
- **User Concentration**: More complex and secure grips require higher concentration and more precise control over the prosthetic.
