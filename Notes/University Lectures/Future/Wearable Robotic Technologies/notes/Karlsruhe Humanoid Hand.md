## Details
Developed by Naoki Fukaya and colleagues, this research hand was presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) in 2013. Key features include:

- **Grasping Capabilities:** Capable of performing multiple grasps defined by Cutkoskyâ€™s grasp taxonomy, relevant for various activities of daily living.
- **Actuation:** Operates using one large servo motor for primary movements and six smaller auxiliary servo motors for finer control, simplifying the mechanical design.
- **Control System:** Lacks complex feedback controls or touch sensors, focusing on simplicity and ease of operation. This approach reduces the weight and mechanical complexity, making it more straightforward but less adaptable to sensory feedback.

The TUAT/Karlsruhe hand exemplifies a research-oriented approach where the primary goal is to test and demonstrate specific technological capabilities, rather than providing a ready-to-use solution for end-users. This kind of development is crucial for advancing the field but does not directly compete with commercial products designed for everyday use.
