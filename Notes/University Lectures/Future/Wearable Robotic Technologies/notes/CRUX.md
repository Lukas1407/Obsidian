### CRUX: Compliant Robotic Upper-extremity eXosuit

**Design and Functionality:**

- **Soft Exosuit**: CRUX is designed as a soft arm exosuit, prioritizing comfort and natural movement. Unlike rigid exoskeletons, it uses soft fabrics and is worn similarly to apparel.
- **Target Audience**: It is specifically aimed at rehabilitating stroke patients, helping them regain arm functions through assisted movements.

**Actuation and Muscle Mimicry:**

- **Soft Actuation**: The exosuit's actuation mimics human arm muscles using tendons that apply forces along the arm, correlated with EMG (electromyography) muscle activation to ensure movements are both natural and supportive.
- **Mapping and Force Application**: The design involves mapping human muscles to support tendons, ensuring that the forces applied mimic natural muscle contractions and assist movement without overriding or hindering voluntary efforts by the user.

**Key Benefits:**

- CRUXâ€™s total weight is only 1.3 kg, enhancing wearability without adding significant bulk or resistance to movement. Its design focuses on unobtrusive, passive behavior with high comfortability, making it suitable for prolonged use in therapeutic settings.
