The knee is one of the largest and most complex joints in the human body, primarily functioning as a modified hinge joint that also allows for a small amount of rotation and lateral movement. 
### Bones and Joints

1. **Modified Hinge Joint**:
   - The knee is formed by the interaction of the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and patella (kneecap). The joint is primarily a hinge joint, enabling flexion (bending) and extension (straightening) of the leg.
   - It includes two condyles (the rounded protrusions at the end of the femur) that articulate with the flat surfaces on the top of the tibia.
2. **Lateral and Rotational Movement**:
   - While the knee is primarily a hinge joint, it also allows for slight lateral and rotational movements. These are mainly restricted by the surrounding muscles and the structure of the joint itself, which includes the shapes of the condyles and the menisci (cartilage pads between femur and tibia).
### Active Flexing and the "Screw-Home" Mechanism

1. **Axis of Rotation**:
   - The axis of rotation in the knee shifts during flexion, a process known as the migration on "the evolute."
   - This migration allows for the condyles of the femur and tibia, which have different shapes, to roll and slide over each other smoothly.
2. **Screw-Home Rotation**:
   - The knee experiences a "screw-home" rotation to lock into full extension, a mechanism necessary for standing upright without continuous muscle contraction.
   - This involves a slight external rotation of the tibia or internal rotation of the femur, approximately 10 degrees.
### Ligaments

1. **Stability and Motion Restriction**:
   - Ligaments around the knee help maintain its stability and prevent dislocation.
   - **Medial and Lateral Collateral Ligaments**: These ligaments prevent excessive lateral motion of the knee.
   - **Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligaments (ACL and PCL)**: They limit the forward and backward sliding of the femur on the tibia during knee flexion and extension and help to prevent hyperextension.
### Forces and Torque

1. **Torque Development**:
   - The knee has a high potential for torque development due to its position between the body's two longest bony leversâ€”the femur and the tibia.
   - **Quadriceps Muscles**: Can produce up to 250 Nm of torque, critical for extending the knee.
   - **Hamstrings**: Can produce up to 125 Nm of torque, primarily used for flexing the knee.
2. **Weight-Bearing and Compression**:
   - As a major weight-bearing joint, the knee handles significant loads, especially during activities like running, jumping, or stair climbing.
   - Compression forces within the knee increase with flexion. This necessitates a larger amount of tension from the quadriceps to counteract these forces and stabilize the knee.
