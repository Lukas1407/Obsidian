> [!abstract] Definition
> Radiopharmaceuticals are a specific type of tracer used in nuclear medicine. They are compounds that contain radionuclides and are used for the diagnosis or treatment of diseases. Radiopharmaceuticals are designed to target specific organs, tissues, or cellular receptors and provide diagnostic information or therapeutic effects based on the radiation they emit 

- They are designed to be selectively concentrated in certain tissues, either normal or diseased, based on their chemical properties.
- Indicator radiopharmaceuticals are divided into two categories: negative indicators and positive indicators.
## Negative Indicators
- Negative indicators are preferentially taken up by normal tissue.
- Pathological areas, such as tumors or regions of infection, do not take up these indicators as well.
- As a result, these pathological areas appear as uptake defects, also known as “cold” areas on the imaging scans.
- This contrast allows doctors to identify areas where the normal function or structure is disrupted.
## Positive Indicators
- Positive indicators, on the other hand, are taken up more by diseased tissue.
- These areas of disease or abnormality will show up as areas of hyperuptake, referred to as “hot” areas on the scans.
- particularly useful for identifying active disease processes, such as cancerous growths, which often have a higher metabolic rate than surrounding healthy tissue.
