> [!abstract] Definition
>  A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator used to accelerate charged particles (such as protons or ions) to high energies for various scientific and medical applications.

- It is needed for [[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)]] -> Takes up a lot of space in the hospital
## Basic Principle
- A cyclotron uses a combination of electric and magnetic fields to accelerate charged particles.
- The particles move in a spiral path within the cyclotron.
## Components and Operation
- Here’s how a cyclotron works step by step: 
### Particle Injection
- Charged particles (usually protons) are injected into the center of the cyclotron.
- These particles are initially at low energy.
### Electric Field Acceleration
- The cyclotron consists of two semi-circular electrodes (called dees).
- These dees are connected to an alternating voltage source.
- As the voltage alternates, it creates an electric field between the dees.
- The charged particles experience an electric force and accelerate along the spiral path.
### Magnetic Field Guidance
- A perpendicular magnetic field is applied across the dees.
- This magnetic field causes the particles to move in a circular path.
- The magnetic force acts as a centripetal force, keeping the particles in a circular trajectory.
### Spiral Path
- The particles continue to accelerate as they move in a spiral path.
- With each revolution, they gain energy from the electric field.
### Extraction
- When the particles reach the desired energy, they are extracted.
- Extraction occurs through a gap between the dees.
- The gap is timed such that the particles exit when they have the desired energy.
## Energy Gain
- The energy gain per revolution in a cyclotron is given by: $$\Delta E = qV$$ where:
	- $q$ is the charge of the particle.
	- $V$ is the voltage across the dees.
## Frequency of Revolution
- The frequency at which the particles complete one revolution depends on the magnetic field strength and the particle’s mass.
- The cyclotron frequency is given by: $$f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}$$ where:
	- $B$ is the magnetic field strength.
	- $m$ is the mass of the particle.
