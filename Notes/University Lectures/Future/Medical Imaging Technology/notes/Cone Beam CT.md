## Geometry Transition from Fan Beam to Cone Beam 
- In traditional multi-slice CT (computed tomography), the X-ray beam geometry is typically fan-shaped. It emits a fan of X-rays that intersect with the patient, and detectors collect the transmitted X-rays from various angles to create cross-sectional images.
- When we increase the number of slices (or detectors) in multi-slice CT, we transition from fan beam geometry to cone beam geometry.
- In CBCT, the X-ray beam forms a cone shape, covering a larger volume of the patient. This cone-shaped beam allows for the acquisition of high-resolution 3D images.

## System Components 
- **Cone-Shaped X-ray Beam**: CBCT systems use a cone-shaped X-ray beam that diverges from a single point source. This cone beam irradiates the patient from various angles.
- **Flat-Panel Detector**: Instead of traditional scintillation detectors, CBCT employs a flat-panel detector. This detector captures the transmitted X-rays after they pass through the patient.
- **High-Resolution Images**: CBCT generates high-resolution images with fine details due to the cone-shaped beam and the flat-panel detector.
## Advantages
- **Excellent Temporal Resolution**: CBCT provides rapid image acquisition, making it suitable for dynamic studies. For example, itâ€™s commonly used in dental imaging for capturing real-time jaw movement during chewing or speaking.
- **3D Visualization**: CBCT produces detailed 3D reconstructions of anatomical structures, which is valuable for surgical planning, dental implant placement, and orthopedic assessments.
- **Reduced Metal Artifacts**: CBCT is less affected by metal artifacts (such as dental fillings or implants) compared to conventional CT scans.
## Disadvantages
- **Scatter Artifacts**: The wide cone-shaped beam can lead to increased scatter radiation. Scatter artifacts may degrade image quality and affect accurate diagnosis.
- **Limited Soft Tissue Contrast**: While CBCT excels in visualizing bone structures, its soft tissue contrast is not as pronounced as in traditional CT scans.
- **Increased Radiation Exposure**: CBCT delivers a higher radiation dose to the patient due to the wider beam and the need for 3D reconstructions.
