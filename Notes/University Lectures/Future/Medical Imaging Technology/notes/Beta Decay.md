>  Beta decay is a type of [[Radioactive Decay|radioactive decay]] where a beta particle, which can be an electron or a positron, is emitted from an atomic nucleus

## $\beta^{-}$ Decay
- I[](Radioactive%20Decay.md)d into a **[[Photon]]**, an **electron** (the beta particle), and an **antineutrino**.
- The equation for β− decay is: $$^{A}_{Z}\textrm{X} \rightarrow ^{A}_{Z+1}\textrm{Y} + \beta^{-} + \bar{\nu}_{e}$$
- Here, $\beta^{-}$ represents the emitted electron, and $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ is the antineutrino.
- Occurs in nuclei with an excess of neutrons.
### Energy
- The energy is lower than for [[Alpha Decay]], as the electron is not as heavy as the Helium-ion
- 0.5-5 MeV
### Penetration
- Beta particles have a mean path length in water or soft tissue of about **1 – 10 mm**.
- Due to their ability to penetrate a short distance into the body, beta particles can cause damage to tissues and are **not viable for internal imaging**.
### Example: Cobalt-60 Beta Decay
$$^{60}_{27}\textrm{Co}\rightarrow ^{60}_{28}\textrm{Ni}+^{0}_{-1}\beta+^{0}_{0}\bar\nu$$
#### [[Energetics|Q-Value Calculation]]
- $$\begin{align} Q_{\beta^{-}}=\Delta P - \Delta D \\ = −61.651−(−64.471)=2.820\text{ MeV}\end{align}$$
- The energy released in the beta decay of cobalt-60 is 2.820 MeV.
- The energy released ($Q$-value) is shared between the emitted beta particle (electron) and the antineutrino.
#### Kinetic Energy
- $$E_{\beta^{-}}+E_{\bar\nu }=Q$$
- The beta particle and antineutrino share the energy in varying proportions, leading to a continuous energy spectrum for the beta particles. Unlike [[Alpha Decay]], where the emitted particle has a discrete energy, beta decay results in a range of possible energies for the emitted electron.
- The energy of the emitted electron ranges from zero up to the maximum value set by the $Q$-value of the decay.
### Special Cases
- **Beta-n**: Beta decay followed by the emission of a neutron.
- **Beta-α\alphaα**: Beta decay followed by the emission of an alpha particle.
- **Beta-p**: Beta decay followed by the emission of a proton.
    - These are rare and occur in specific isotopes where the resulting nucleus is sufficiently excited to emit additional particles.

## $\beta^{+}$ Decay
- In β+ decay, a **proton** is converted into a **neutron**, a **positron** (the beta particle), and a **neutrino**.
- The equation for β+ decay is: $$^{A}_{Z}\textrm{X} \rightarrow ^{A}_{Z-1}\textrm{Y} + \beta^{+} + \nu_{e}$$ 
- Here, $\beta^{+}$ is the emitted positron, and $\nu_{e}$ is the neutrino.
- Positrons quickly **[[Annihilation|annihilate]]** with electrons nearby, producing **two photons**. This annihilation is utilized in **[[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)]]** imaging.
- Occurs in nuclei with an excess of protons.
- Beta-plus decay is only possible if the mass defect (energy difference) of the parent nucleus is greater than twice the rest mass of an electron (1.022 MeV).
### Positron Annihilation
- After being emitted, a positron (β+\beta^+β+) will eventually encounter an electron (e−e^-e−) in the surrounding matter.
- **Annihilation Reaction**:$$\beta^{+}+e^{-}\rightarrow 2 \gamma$$
	- The positron and electron annihilate each other, resulting in the emission of two gamma photons.****
