> [!tldr] Definition
> Spatial frequency refers to the number of changes in intensity (from dark to light or vice versa) that occur per unit of distance in an image. Itâ€™s a measure of how often structures change in space, which corresponds to the level of detail or fineness in the image.
It measures how often sinusoidal components (determined by the [[Fourier Transform]]) of a structure repeat per unit of distance. 

- Higher spatial frequencies are associated with finer details, such as the edges of small structures or subtle changes in tissue density
- For images it describes how fast the gray levels changes over space in the image
