> [!abstract] Definition
>  SPECT stands for Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography. It is a type of nuclear medicine imaging technique that allows doctors to visualize how well internal organs are functioning using [[Radioactive Tracers]] and special gamma cameras.

## Purpose and Function
- A SPECT scan provides detailed, 3D pictures of organs, tissues, and bones inside the body.
- Unlike many other imaging tests that show organ structures, SPECT reveals organ function. It demonstrates how blood flows through arteries and veins to organs and tissues.
### Common types of SPECT scans
- SPECT Brain Scan: Detects altered blood flow in the brain, helping diagnose neurological conditions such as seizures, strokes, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injuries.
- SPECT Heart Scan: Evaluates heart function, diagnosing conditions like scar tissue (indicating a heart attack), coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and poor circulation. It also assesses recovery after heart procedures.
- SPECT Bone Scan: Detects issues like stress fractures, bone infections, and bone cancer or metastasis
## How SPECT Works
- A SPECT scan involves two main steps:
1. Radiotracer Administration: A radiotracer (a safe, radioactive substance) is either injected into a vein, swallowed, or inhaled. As it moves through the body, it accumulates in specific areas, providing information about organ and tissue function. These radiotracers then emit [[Gamma Ray|gamma rays]] which are detected
2. [[Gamma Camera]] Imaging: A special gamma camera detects gamma ray emissions from the radiotracer. The camera rotates around the patient, capturing images from different angles. These images are then reconstructed into 3D pictures, revealing functional information

- The SPECT consists, in the simplest version, of a gamma-camera capable of rotating 360° around the patient. The gamma-camera coupled to a collimator with parallel holes acquires images, projected in different angular positions (angular sampling), of the 3D distribution of the radiopharmaceutical.

- Due to the looses in energy, an approach is to use multiple detection heads to improve the temproal resolution
