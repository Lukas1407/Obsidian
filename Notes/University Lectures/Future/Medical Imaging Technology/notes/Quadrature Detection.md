- **Vector Representation of Signal:** The MR signal is represented as a vector with real (Re) and imaginary (Im) components. These components are typically recorded from the I (In-phase) and Q (Quadrature) channels respectively.
- **Direction of Rotation:** The use of two coils allows the system to discern the direction of rotation of the magnetization vector MMM, which helps differentiate between positive and negative frequencies. This capability is critical for accurately interpreting the phase and frequency of the MR signals.
- **Stereo Signal:** The dual-coil setup provides a "stereo" signal effect, enhancing the dimensional perception of the signal by capturing its different aspects simultaneously, much like how stereo sound offers a richer auditory experience than mono.
