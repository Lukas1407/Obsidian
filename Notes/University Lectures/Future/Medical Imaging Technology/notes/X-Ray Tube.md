- **Vacuum Tube**: This allows electrons to move freely without colliding with air molecules.
- **Potential Difference**: The potential difference between the cathode and anode can range from **15kV to 150kV**. This high voltage is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">necessary to accelerate the electrons from the cathode to the anode with enough energy to produce X-rays</mark>.
	- The amount of voltage and the current through the cathode can be adjusted depending on what is being imaged. 
	- For example, imaging a hand requires a lower voltage compared to imaging the whole body.
- **Transformer**: A transformer is used to step up the voltage from the power supply to the high voltage needed for the X-ray tube.
- **Electrodes**: There are two electrodes inside the tube:
### Cathode
- This is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">negatively charged electrode that serves as the source of electrons</mark>. 
- It typically consists of one or two <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">tungsten filaments that are heated to a high temperature</mark> (around 2200°C)
- The high temperature <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">causes thermionic emission, where electrons are released</mark> from the filament.
- **Focusing Cup**: Usually made of molybdenum, the focusing cup is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">negatively charged</mark>. It <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">helps to focus the stream of electrons towards the anode and prevents them from spreading out</mark>.
#### Why Tungsten
- An excellent thermionic emitter, meaning it efficiently emits electrons when heated. 
- A very high melting point (3422°C) which is necessary to withstand the extreme temperatures without melting.
#### Accelerating Voltage
- The voltage applied to accelerate electrons in the cathode tube.
- The maximum energy of the X-ray photons produced is directly proportional to the accelerating voltage.
	- Higher voltage means more kinetic energy for the electrons.
	- This results in higher energy X-rays.
- The maximum energy corresponds to the minimum wavelength of the X-rays, given by the relationship $$E = h \cdot \frac{c}{\lambda}$$
### Anode
- This is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">positively charged electrode that serves as the target for the electrons</mark>. 
- If the incoming electrons have enough energy, they can knock out electrons from the inner shells of the target atoms.
- This creates a vacancy in an inner shell.
- Electrons from higher energy outer shells fall into the lower energy vacancy.
- The energy difference between the shells is released as an X-ray photon with a specific energy.
- The emitted X-rays have specific energies corresponding to the energy difference between the shells.
- This results in sharp lines superposed on the continuous spectrum, called "characteristic lines."

#### X-Ray Production
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">When the electrons from the cathode strike the anode, X-rays are produced</mark>. ^d848e9
- The anode is made of a material with a high atomic number (Z), such as **tungsten (Z=74)**, which is typical for general radiograph
	- For specialized applications like mammography, materials like molybdenum (Z=42) or rhodium (Z=45) may be used
- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">anode is set on a rotating plate</mark> that can spin at high speeds, often around 10,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). 
	- This rotation helps to distribute the heat generated by the electron impact over a larger area, preventing damage to the anode
- The anode material <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">must have a very high melting temperature</mark> to withstand the intense heat generated during X-ray production. -> Tungsten
- The positive charge of the anode attracts the negatively charged electrons from the cathode. The kinetic energy of the electrons is determined by the high voltage potential between the anode and cathode
- When the accelerated electrons collide with the anode, their <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">kinetic energy is transformed</mark> primarily into <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">heat</mark> (about 99%) and a small portion into <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">X-rays</mark> (about 1%). This conversion is crucial for the imaging process
	-  via [[Bremsstrahlung Radiaton]] (~85%) and [[Characteristic Radiation]] (~15%).
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A lead shield is used to prevent X-rays from irradiating in undesired directions</mark>, ensuring that the X-ray beam is directed only towards the area of interest
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The angle of the anode affects the size of the effective focal spot and the direction of the X-ray beam</mark>. 
	- Most X-ray tubes have an anode angle between 12-15 degrees, which allows the produced beam to exit the tube perpendicular to the electron beam
