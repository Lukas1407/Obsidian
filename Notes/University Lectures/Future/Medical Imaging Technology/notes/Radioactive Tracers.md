- These are special compounds that emit radiation, which are introduced into the body
- In the context of nuclear imaging, a tracer is typically a [[Radionuclide|radionuclide]] that has been incorporated into a compound that targets specific cells or organs in the body.
- They are used to **detect structures** that may not be visible through conventional imaging techniques.
	- Like metabolism
- Radioactive markers can also **evaluate the distribution** of functional activities within an anatomical structure, such as how a drug is processed by the body or how blood flows through the brain.
- Radioisotopes are bounded in molecules of complexes and can be introduced into the body by:
	- injection
	- oral intake 
	- inhalation
## Which Radioactive Tracers to choose
- Depends on:
### Energy
- Needs to be high enough to penetrate the patient
- Not to high to cause excessive harm
### [[Half-Life Time]]
- Long enough for the Radiotracer to be incorporated in the metabolic process 
- Long enough that we don't need tons of it
- Short enough to ensure minimum possible radiation damage to the patient
### Biological factor
 - High biological specificity for the organ that is to be imaged
	 - Should, if possible, only bind to the organ we want to image
	 - Radioactive marker can bind to multiple different ligands that are specific to organs 
	 - Strong binding to the complex so the radio marker does not fragment into the body
