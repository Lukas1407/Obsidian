> [!tldr] Definition
>  Gamma decay occurs when an atomic nucleus transitions from an **excited state** (or a **metastable state**) to a lower energy state.

- The nucleus releases a **[[Photon]]** (a gamma ray) during this transition.
- The equation for gamma decay is: $${A}_{Z}\textrm{X}^{*} \rightarrow ^{A}_{Z}\textrm{X} + \gamma$$
    - Here:
        - (${A}_{Z}\textrm{X}^*$) represents the **excited nucleus**.
        - ($^{A}_{Z}\textrm{X}$) represents the **ground state nucleus** after emitting the gamma ray.
        - ($\gamma$) denotes the emitted **high-energy photon** ([[Gamma Ray|gamma ray]]).
## Energy
- Gamma rays have an energy range of approximately **10 keV to 10 MeV**.
- Unlike alpha and beta particles, gamma rays are **highly penetrating** due to their lack of charge and small mass.
- They can **penetrate tissue** and other materials with **exponential decay**.
## Metastable States
- Some nuclei exist in metastable states (denoted by "m" following the element and mass number, e.g., $\text{Tc-99m}$Tc-).
- These states are relatively stable but can decay to the ground state by emitting a gamma photon.
- Metastable states have longer lifetimes compared to typical gamma decay processes, making them useful in various applications such as medical imaging.
## Example: Cs-137 Decay
- **Step 1**: Cs-137 undergoes beta decay, transforming into Ba-137m.
- **Step 2**: Ba-137m, in an excited metastable state, emits a gamma photon to reach a lower energy state.
- **Step 3**: The emitted gamma photon has a specific energy (661.7 keV), characteristic of this transition, which can be detected and measured.

## Applications
- **X-ray imaging**: Gamma rays are used in medical X-rays and radiography.
- **[[Computed Tomography (CT)]]**: CT scans utilize gamma rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body.
- **[[Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)]]**: SPECT imaging relies on gamma rays emitted by radiopharmaceuticals to visualize internal structures and detect diseases.
