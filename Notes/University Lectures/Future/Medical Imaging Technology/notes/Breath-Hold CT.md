> [!abstract] Definition
>  Breath-hold CT refers to a specific technique used in [[Computed Tomography (CT)]] imaging where the patient is required to hold their breath during the scan. This is particularly important when imaging areas affected by respiratory motion, such as the lungs or upper abdomen

## Options
### Self-held breath-hold without respiratory monitoring
- This is the simplest form of breath-hold technique. The patient is instructed to take a breath in or out and hold it while the CT images are acquired. This method doesn’t use any equipment to monitor the patient’s breathing and is often used when resources are limited.
### Active breathing control with a spirometer
- A spirometer is a device that measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled by the lungs. In this method, the spirometer is used to help the patient hold a consistent lung volume during the scan. This consistency allows for more accurate imaging, as the position of organs and tissues remains stable.
### Self-held breath-hold with respiratory monitoring
- This approach also involves the patient holding their breath, but their respiratory function is monitored using equipment. This allows the medical team to ensure that the patient’s breath-hold is at the correct lung volume and that it’s maintained throughout the scan.
### Abdominal press 
- This technique may involve the patient or a technician applying pressure to the abdomen to stabilize the area and reduce the effects of breathing on the scan. It’s another method to maintain a consistent position of the organs during the breath-hold.
