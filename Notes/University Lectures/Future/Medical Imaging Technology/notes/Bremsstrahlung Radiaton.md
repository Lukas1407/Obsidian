> [!abstract] Definition
>  Braking radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation that’s produced when a charged particle, such as an electron, is decelerated or deflected by another charged particle, typically an atomic nucleus

- The energy loss is not quantized, leading to a continuous spectrum of X-rays with varying energies and wavelengths:

## In the context  of [[X-Ray Imaging]]
1. **High-energy electrons** are accelerated and directed towards a metal target in the X-ray tube.
2. As these electrons interact with the metal atoms, they are attracted to the positively charged nuclei.
3. This attraction causes the electrons to **slow down** and change direction.
4. The **loss of kinetic energy** from this deceleration is emitted as a photon, which is the Bremsstrahlung X-ray
- The closer the electron to the nucleus the stronger the force the higher the released energy 
- Released energy is a continuous spectrum from 0 to $eU_{peak}$ 
- The maximum depends on the tube voltage
