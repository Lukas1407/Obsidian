- $X$ is the element
## Atomic Number $Z$
- The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
- Determines the element and its chemical properties
- In a neutral atom (a stable element), this is also the number of electrons
- For example, carbon always has 6 protons, so its atomic number $Z$ is 6.
## Number of Neutrons $N$
- The number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.
- Neutrons contribute to the mass of the atom but do not affect its chemical properties.
## Mass Number $A$
- The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.
- $A = Z+N$
- $A$ gives an approximate mass of the nucleus in [[Atomic Mass Unit (AMU)]]
- Atomic number is related to Electron density which describes how electrons are distributed around the nucleus (Schrödinger wave function)

## Isotopes
- Variants of the same chemical element that have the same number of protons ($Z$) but different numbers of neutrons ($N$).
### Characteristics
- Same chemical properties because they have the same number of protons.
- Different physical properties due to the difference in mass.
### Examples 
- $^{12}C$: 6 protons, 6 neutrons ($A=12$)
- $^{13} \text{C}$: 6 protons, 7 neutrons ($A=13$)
- $^{14} \text{C}$: 6 protons, 8 neutrons ($A=14$)

## Interest in Medical Imaging
- In [[Nuclear Imaging]], the interest in the nucleus comes from the fact that the behavior of the radioactive tracers (which are usually isotopes that undergo nuclear reactions) can tell us a lot about physiological processes.
- In [[X-Ray Imaging]], the focus on the atom, particularly the electron cloud, is because X-rays interact with the electrons. This interaction is what produces the image, as areas with higher atomic numbers (and thus higher electron density) will absorb more X-rays and appear differently on the image.
