> [!abstract] Definition
>  DBT allows for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the breast from multiple two-dimensional projections, similar to [[Computed Tomography (CT)]].


- The X-ray tube moves in an arc over the breast, taking a series of low-dose images from different angles.
## Mammography vs. DBT
- While traditional mammography produces 2D images, DBT provides a 3D representation, offering improved visualization of overlapping breast tissues and potentially leading to better cancer detection rates
