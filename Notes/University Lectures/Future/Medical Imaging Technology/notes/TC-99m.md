- Is the most used radioactive marker for [[Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)]]
- Reaction chain: $$^{99}Mo\rightarrow ^{99m}Tc\rightarrow ^{99}Tc$$
## Production in Hospitals
- $^{99}Mo$ is provided to the hospital on a regular (weekly) basis
- $^{99}Mo$ is bounded to $MoO_{4}^{2-}$ which strongly couples to Alumina
- The $MoO_{4}^{2-}$ decays to $TcO_{4}^{-}$ which couples less strongly to the alumina
- Using a saline solution the $TcO_{4}^{-}$ can be separated from the alumina

- Each day the $^{99m}Tc$ is separated from the $^{99}Mo$ and used for clinical use
- Number of $^{99m}Tc$ atoms is at a maximum after ~22,5h making it perfect for clinical daily routine
