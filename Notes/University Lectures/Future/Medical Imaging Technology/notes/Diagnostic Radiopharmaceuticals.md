> [!abstract] Definition
> Diagnostic Radiopharmaceuticals are used to gather information about a disease or the function of an organ. They must deliver the **minimum radiation dose** necessary to acquire the required diagnostic images or data. The low dose is crucial to minimize the patient’s exposure to radiation, thereby reducing the risk of potential radiation-induced harm, while still providing clear and accurate diagnostic information
