> [!abstract] Definition 
>  Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is an advanced imaging technique that builds upon the traditional three-dimensional CT scans by incorporating time as the fourth dimension, allowing for the visualization of changes in anatomy or structures over time, particularly in response to motion such as breathing or cardiac motion.

- This allows for the observation of dynamic changes within the body’s anatomy over a period, such as the movement caused by breathing or heartbeat.

- 4DCT captures multiple images, or ‘slices,’ of the same area during a complete breathing cycle. This means that the scanner takes pictures at various stages, such as full inhalation and full exhalation, to track how the internal structures move with each breath.
- The CT scanner is synchronized with the patient’s respiratory signal. This ensures that the images correspond accurately to the different phases of the breathing cycle.
- The collected images are organized based on the amplitude or phase of the patient’s breathing. This categorization can include stages like:
	- Full inhale
	- Mid inhale
	- Mid exhale
	- Full exhale
- In this method, it's necessary to acquire the patient's respiratory signal, there are 3 methods:
	- **Pulmonary Volume Measurement**: This method measures the volume of air the lungs can hold and how it changes during the breathing cycle.
	- **Diaphragm Motion Monitoring**: A strain gauge belt is used to monitor the diaphragm’s movement. This belt detects changes in size or shape and generates a corresponding voltage signal.
	- **Optical Tracking**: This involves tracking either external markers placed on the patient’s body or implanted points to monitor movement.

## Retrospective 4DCT
- In this method, images are captured throughout the entire respiratory cycle. After the scan, these images are reordered based on the respiratory signal acquired during the scan. 
- This allows for a comprehensive view of the anatomy as it changes with each breath
## Prospective (Gated) CT
- Here, images are acquired only at a specific phase of the respiratory cycle, typically when motion is minimal to reduce blurring. This is often referred to as ‘gated’ because the acquisition is synchronized or ‘gated’ to a particular phase
- In gated CT, the breathing signal is acquired, and the X-ray tube’s activity is synchronized with a specific window of this signal. Exhalation is often used because it’s the most repeatable and stable part of the breathing cycle

## Cine Mode
- In cine mode, the scanning table remains stationary, and multiple images are taken at each couch position during a complete breathing cycle. This mode is generally faster and is based on a single breathing cycle per set of images. However, it requires additional time to move the table between sets, approximately 1 second per set 
## Helical Mode 
- Unlike cine mode, helical mode involves continuous table movement and image acquisition as the gantry rotates. The data from helical mode can relate to two different respiratory cycles, which can be a consideration for image consistency 
## Cardiac CT
- Cardiac CT involves synchronizing the X-ray tube with the electrocardiogram (ECG) to capture images at specific times in the cardiac cycle, reducing motion artifacts
- CTA: computed tomography angiography (used to visualize the inside, or lumen, of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries, veins, and the heart chambers)
