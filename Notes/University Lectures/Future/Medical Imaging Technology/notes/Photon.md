- Photons are massless, so they always move at the speed of light ($c$) in vacuum
- Photons have both wave-like and particle-like properties ([[Photon#Wave-Particle Duality|wave-particle duality]])
## Wave-Particle Duality
### Wave-like Properties
- **Interference**: When light from multiple sources overlaps, it can interfere constructively (waves in phase amplify each other) or destructively (waves out of phase cancel each other). This is evident in experiments like the double-slit experiment, where light creates an interference pattern.
- **Diffraction**: Light waves spread out when they pass through a small aperture or around an obstacle. This bending and spreading of waves is a characteristic behavior of waves.
### Particle-like Properties
- **Photoelectric Effect**: In the photoelectric effect, photons strike a material and transfer their energy to electrons, ejecting them from the material. This demonstrates the particle nature of light, as energy is transferred in discrete packets (quanta).
- **Energy Quantization**: Photons have energy proportional to their frequency, described by the equation $$E = h \cdot f$$where $E$ is energy, $h$ is Planckâ€™s constant, and $f$ is frequency. This relationship shows that light has quantized energy levels, a property of particles
