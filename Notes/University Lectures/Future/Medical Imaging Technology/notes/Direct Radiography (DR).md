### Gadolinium Oxysulfite (Gd2O2S)
- Used in film radiography.
- Presents a disorganized pattern, leading to more blur in the image.
- It is a cheap and very strong intensifier.
### Caesium Iodide (CsI)
- Produces less light, resulting in less blur and higher spatial resolution.
- More expensive than Gd2O2S.
- Often used in combination with fiber optic coupling to guide the light to the detector.
## Indirect Conversion
In summary, indirect conversion detectors like CCD/CMOS use scintillators and optical systems to convert X-rays to light and then to electrical signals, while TFT-based detectors also use scintillators but employ a photodiode array for conversion to electrical signals. Direct radiography typically refers to systems that convert X-rays directly to electrical charges without the intermediate step of light conversion
### CCD/CMOS
- Charged Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS):
- These detectors use a scintillator to convert incident X-ray energy into light.
- The emitted light is then focused onto the CCD/CMOS chip using an optical lens or optical fibers.
- The CCD/CMOS chip converts the light energy into an electrical current, which is then digitized to create an image.
### Thin-Film Transistor (TFT)
- In this setup, X-rays are converted to visible light by a scintillator.
- A photodiode/transistor array then converts the visible light into an electrical signal.
- This signal is amplified and converted into a digital signal, forming the basis of the digital image.
## Direct Conversion
1. **Direct Flat Panel Detectors**:
    - These detectors are based on flat panels made of amorphous selenium (aSe).
    - When X-rays interact with aSe, they generate electron-hole pairs within the material.
    - This interaction directly produces an electrical current, eliminating the need for a scintillation process.
2. **Image Quality**:
    - The impulse response of direct flat panel detectors is sharper compared to indirect systems.
    - The image resolution is higher because there is no spread of light photons, which can blur the image in indirect systems.
