- **Radionuclides** are atoms that have an unstable nucleus and emit radiation as they decay to a more stable form]. They can be found naturally in the environment or can be artificially produced in laboratories or nuclear reactors. Radionuclides have a wide range of applications, including in medicine, industry, and research
- Radionuclides used in [[Nuclear Imaging|nuclear imaging]] emit ionizing radiation in the form of alpha (⍺) particles, beta (β) particles, or gamma (γ) rays. These emissions are intrinsic to the radionuclide and continue until the substance decays to a stable state or is eliminated from the body
