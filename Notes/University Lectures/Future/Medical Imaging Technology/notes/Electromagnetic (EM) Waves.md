## Self-Propagating
- EM waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">without the need for a medium</mark>. 
- They are self-sustaining because <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the changing electric field generates a magnetic field, and vice versa</mark>.
## Amplitude and Photons
- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">amplitude of an EM wave is related to the intensity of the light, which is proportional to the number of photons</mark>. 
- More photons mean a higher amplitude and brighter light.
## Wavelength
- The wavelength of light determines the scale of interaction with objects. For example, different wavelengths are responsible for different colors in the visible spectrum and can also affect how light interacts with materials at the microscopic level.
## Energy and Ionization
- The energy of EM radiation is crucial for processes like ionization, where enough energy can remove an electron from an atom. The ability to ionize atoms depends on the energy of the photons.
