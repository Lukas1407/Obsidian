- DSA is particularly useful because it removes the “noise” of other structures, allowing clinicians to focus solely on the blood vessels.
## Process
1. **Non-Contrast Image (Mask Image)**: Initially, an image of the area of interest is taken without any contrast material. This image captures the anatomy of the region, including bones and other tissues, and serves as the “mask” or reference image.
2. **Contrast Injection**: Next, a contrast material, usually iodine-based, is injected into the bloodstream. This contrast material makes the blood vessels visible under X-ray imaging.
3. **Contrast Images**: As the contrast material flows through the blood vessels, images are taken. These images show the blood vessels filled with the contrast material, appearing as bright on the X-ray, superimposed over the anatomical structures.
4. **Image Subtraction**: The key step in DSA is the subtraction process. The pre-contrast mask image is digitally subtracted from the post-contrast images. This means that the overlapping anatomical structures that were present in both sets of images are removed, leaving behind a clear view of the blood vessels.
5. **Visualization**: The resulting images highlight the blood vessels without any interference from other tissues, providing a high-contrast and detailed view of the vascular system.
