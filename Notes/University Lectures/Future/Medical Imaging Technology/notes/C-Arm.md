> [!abstract] Definition
> The C-Arm is a clinical device <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">combining the X-ray tube</mark> and a way to detect the image, usually an <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">image intensifier or a flat panel screen</mark> followed by <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a video camera</mark> for acquiring the image.

## Design
- It has its name because of its C-shape.
- This design provides structural stability and flexibility in positioning.
### Portability
- One of the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">key advantages of the C-Arm</mark> is its portability. 
- It <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">can be easily moved and positioned around the patient</mark>, which is particularly useful in operating rooms where space and access can be limited.
### Rotational Capability
- The C-Arm <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">can rotate in multiple spatial directions</mark>, including horizontal, vertical, and even rotational movements around swivel axes. 
- This <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">allows to obtain images from almost any angle without moving the patient</mark>, which is crucial during complex procedures
### Remote Control
- Many C-Arm models can be operated remotely, enhancing the convenience and efficiency of the imaging process. This feature allows for adjustments to be made from a distance, reducing the need for physical repositioning.
### 3D Imaging
- Advanced C-Arm systems <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">are capable of performing 3D imaging by capturing a series of 2D X-ray projections</mark> during a sweep around the subject. These images can then be reconstructed into 3D models, providing valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment planning
