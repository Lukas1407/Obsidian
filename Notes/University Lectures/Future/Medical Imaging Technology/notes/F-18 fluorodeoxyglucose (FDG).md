- body takes it in like normal glucose; especially tumors take in a lot of glucose -> great for visualizing tumors
- Stable F19 is substituted with the radioactive F18 
- F18 has a half-life time of ~110 minutes (very short -> transport not feasible) therefore the radioactive F18 must be produced in the hospital
- Produced with the help of a [[Cyclotron]] protons are fired at heavy water: $$^{18}_{8}O+p\rightarrow^{18}_{9}N+n$$ where:
	- $(^{18}_{8}O)$ represents oxygen-18.
	- $(p)$ represents a proton.
	- $(^{18}_{9}N)$ represents nitrogen-18.
	- $(n)$ represents a neutron.
## Use cases
### Diagnosis of Tumors
- Tumor cells typically have a higher rate of glucose metabolism compared to normal cells.
- FDG accumulates in these high-metabolism areas, making tumors visible on PET scans as areas of increased uptake or “hot spots.”
### Diagnosis of Metastasis
- Metastasis refers to the spread of cancer from the primary site to other parts of the body.
- FDG-PET scans can detect these secondary cancerous growths due to their similar high glucose uptake.
### Differentiation Between Benign and Malignant Tissue
- Malignant tumors generally have higher metabolic rates than benign ones.
- FDG-PET scans can help differentiate between the two by showing the metabolic activity level, aiding in diagnosis.
### Staging
- Staging involves determining the extent of cancer spread.
- FDG-PET scans provide crucial information on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of distant metastases, which is vital for staging cancer.
### Limitations
- Slowly Growing Tumors: These may not be easily seen on FDG-PET images because they might have reduced glucose uptake.
- High Blood Sugar: Can interfere with the scan’s accuracy. Elevated blood sugar levels can cause FDG to distribute more uniformly throughout the body, increasing background noise and reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. This makes it harder to distinguish areas of abnormal uptake1.
