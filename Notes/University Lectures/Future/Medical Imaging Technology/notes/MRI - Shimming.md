> **Shimming** refers to the process of adjusting the magnetic field within an MRI scanner to be as uniform as possible across the imaging volume. This is critical because any inhomogeneity (variance in magnetic field strength) can lead to image artifacts, reduced image quality, and inaccurate diagnostic results. 

### Why is Homogeneity Important?
- **Homogeneity** of the magnetic field ensures that the Larmor frequency (the frequency at which atomic nuclei within a magnetic field absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation) remains constant across the imaging volume. This uniformity is essential for accurate spatial encoding and image clarity.
### How is Shimming Achieved?
1. **Passive Shimming:**
   - Involves physically adjusting the position of ferromagnetic materials within the magnet assembly during manufacture or installation. This method is mainly used to correct for static inhomogeneities in the magnetic field caused by imperfections in the magnet.
2. **Active Shimming:**
   - Uses adjustable currents passed through specialized shim coils that are built into the MRI scanner. These coils generate small magnetic fields that can be finely tuned to correct for minute variations in the main magnetic field. The adjustments can be made based on the specific requirements of each scan or to compensate for the presence of a patient in the scanner.
### Measuring Field Homogeneity
- **Parts Per Million (PPM):**
  - Magnetic field homogeneity is typically measured in parts per million (ppm), which quantifies the variation in the magnetic field strength relative to the main field across the designated Diameter of Spherical Volume (DSV). The DSV is a measure of the volume within the scanner where the field needs to be homogeneous.
- **Example Calculations:**
  - For a 1.5 Tesla MRI system:
    - Larmor frequency for protons = 63.86 MHz.
    - A homogeneity of 10 ppm would mean a frequency variation of ± 638 Hz around this central frequency within the shimmed volume.
  - For a 0.5 Tesla system:
    - Larmor frequency for protons = 21.28 MHz.
    - Similarly, 10 ppm homogeneity means a frequency variation of ± 213 Hz.
### Homogeneity Standards:
- **Low vs. High Field Systems:**
  - Low field MRI systems (e.g., <1 Tesla) might accept a homogeneity deviation around 20 ppm over a 20 cm DSV.
  - High field systems (>1 Tesla), which are used for more detailed imaging, typically require much tighter control, around 1 ppm or less, to ensure the greater detail and contrast in the images are not compromised by field inhomogeneities.
