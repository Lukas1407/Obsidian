- The atom is a quantum-mechanical system governed by the wave function postulated and published by SchrÃ¶dinger in 1926 
- This function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the atom's nucleus
- These orbitals are described by wave functions and can have different shapes (e.g., spherical, dumbbell-shaped) corresponding to different energy levels and angular momentum states.
- There are 4 known orbital shapes describing the probability region:
## **s**

- can hold up to $4*0+2$-> max 2 electrons
## **p**

- can hold up to $4*1+2$ -> max 6 electrons
## **d**

- can hold up to $4*2+2$ -> max 10 electrons
## **f**
