A long, usually thin, extension of the neuron, that conducts electrical impulses, known as [[Action Potential]], generated in the soma away from the cells body. ^27729c

They can be: stimulating (increases [[Membrane potential]]), or inhibiting (decreases [[Membrane potential]]) depending on the location where they bind to the next [[Neuron]] and the [[Neurotransmitter]] the [[Synapses]] release.
- Further away from the [[Neuron#Structure|Soma]], binding to [[Neuron#Structure|Dendrites]] -> stimulating 
- Close to the [[Neuron#Structure|Soma]], binding to it -> inhibiting
