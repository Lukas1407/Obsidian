> [!summary] Definition
> A motor skill is a function that involves specific movements of the body's  [[Muscle|muscles]] to perform a certain task. These tasks could include walking, running, or riding a bike. In order to perform this skill, the body's [[Nervous System|nervous system]], muscles, and [[Brain|brain]] have to all work together. 

## Types of Motor Skills
Tasks cannot always be strictly divided into gross and fine motor skills. Discrete tasks such as switch gears in an automobile, grasping an object, for example usually require more fine motor skill than gross motor skills.
### Gross motor skills
- Require the use of large muscles groups in our legs, torso, and arms to perform
- We use our gross motor skills on a daily basis without putting much thought or effort into them
- The performance level of gross motor skill remains unchanged after periods of non-use
- Can be further divided into two subgroups
	-  Locomotor skills, such as running, jumping, sliding, and swimming
	- Object-control skills such as throwing, catching, dribbling, and kicking
### Fine motor skills
- Require the use of smaller muscle groups to perform smaller movements
- These muscles include those found in our wrists, hands, fingers, feet and in our toes. 
- These tasks are precise in nature like: playing the piano, tying shoelaces, brushing your teeth, and flossing
-  Some fine motor skills may be susceptible to retention loss of over a period of time if not in use: "if you don't use it, you lose it" 
### Voluntary motor skills
- Tasks that are consciously controlled by the [[Brain|brain]]
### Involuntary motor skills
- Tasks that cannot be controlled and are done by the [[Autonomic Nervous System|ANS]] and the [[Spinal Cord|Spinal Cord]]
### Psychomotoric
- The two-way relationship between the psychological state and the movement of the muscles
- -> The psyche influences the motor skills and vice versa
### Sensomotoric
- The relationships between [[Natural Senses|sensory]] stimuli and responses in the muscles
