## Structure
### Sympathetic Division
- Known as the “fight or flight” system
- Prepares the body for intense physical activity
- Increases heart rate, dilates airways to improve oxygen intake, and activates the release of [[Glucose|glucose]] for energy
- Also inhibits non-essential functions like digestion during times of stress or emergency
### Parasympathetic Division
-  Known as the “rest and digest” system 
- Conserves energy as it slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles in the gastrointestinal tract
- Helps maintain normal body functions and conserves physical resources
