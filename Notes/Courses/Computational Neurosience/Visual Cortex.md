The **visual cortex** is the area in the [[Brain]] the processes visual information. it is located in the [[Lobes of the brain#Occipital Lobe|occipital lobe]]. 
Sensory input originating from the eyes travels through the [[Thalamus#Lateral Geniculate Nucleus|lateral geniculate nucleus]] in the [[Thalamus|thalamus]] and then reaches the visual cortex.

The area of the visual cortex that receives the sensory input from the [[Thalamus#Lateral Geniculate Nucleus|lateral geniculate nucleus]] is the [[Visual Cortex#Primary Visual Cortex (V1)|primary visual cortex]], also known as visual area 1 (V1).

[[Neuron|Neurons]] in the visual cortex fire [[Action Potential]] when visual stimuli appear within their receptive field.

## Primary Visual Cortex (V1)
It is highly specialized for <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">processing information about static and moving objects</mark> and is excellent in <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">pattern recognition</mark>. Moreover, V1 is characterized by a laminar organization, with six distinct layers, each playing a unique role in visual processing. Neurons in the superficial layers (II and III) are often involved in local processing and communication within the cortex, while neurons in the deeper layers (V and VI) often send information to other brain regions involved in higher-order visual processing and decision-making.
