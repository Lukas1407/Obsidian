An **electrical current** is the flow of [[Electrical Charge|electrical charge]] from one place to another.

## In Biology
For [[Ion Channels]], the inward current $I_m$ is equal to the rate of change of [[Electrical Charge|electrical charge]] $Q$, on the inside of the [[Zellmembran|cell's membrane]]:
$$
I_{m} = \frac{dQ}{dt}
$$
This is based on the principle of [[Electrical Charge#^c34a1f|conservation of charge]], which states that charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. Therefore, the amount of charge that enters the cell must be equal to the amount of charge that accumulates on the membrane.
