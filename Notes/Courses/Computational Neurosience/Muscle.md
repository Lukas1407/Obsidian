- Are around 30-40% of the body mass
- 2 different types of muscles: [[Muscle#Striated muscles]] and [[Muscle#Smooth muscles|smooth muscles]]

## Types of Muscles
### Striated muscles
- Appear striped because of the presence of sarcomeres![[Pasted image 20240307083828.jpg|300]]
#### Cardiac Muscle
- Found in the heart.
- Cells usually have a single central nucleus.
- Rich in mitochondria and myoglobin for energy and oxygen storage.
- Cells are interconnected by intercalated disks, facilitating synchronized contractions.
#### Skeletal Muscle
- Attached to bones and enables movement.
- Encased in connective tissue layers: epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium.
- Contains multiple nuclei beneath the sarcolemma (cell membrane).
- Composed of myofibrils with actin and myosin filaments forming sarcomeres.
- Classified based on contraction speed and metabolism: slow-oxidative (Type I) or fast-oxidative (Type II).
### Smooth muscles
Smooth muscle is a type of muscle tissue that operates involuntarily and lacks the striated appearance of skeletal and cardiac muscles.![[Pasted image 20240307084229.jpg|300]]
It’s essential for various bodily functions and is categorized into two main types:
#### Single-Unit Smooth Muscle:
- Also known as unitary smooth muscle.
- Cells contract together as one unit, functioning as a syncytium.
- Common in organs that contract rhythmically, such as the intestines.
#### Multiunit Smooth Muscle:
- Composed of individual muscle fibers.
- Allows for precise control and gradual contractions.
- Found in the iris of the eye and the walls of blood vessels.

Smooth muscle is present in many parts of the body, including:
- **Vascular Smooth Muscle:** In the walls of arteries and veins, controlling blood flow and pressure.
- **Uterine Smooth Muscle:** In the uterus, playing a role during childbirth.
- **Gastrointestinal Tract:** Aiding in digestion by moving food along the digestive system.
- **Respiratory Tract:** Helping regulate airway constriction and dilation.

Despite being structurally similar across different organs, the stimuli that activate smooth muscle vary, allowing it to fulfill specific functions at the right times. For example, mesangial cells in the kidneys, which resemble smooth muscle cells, help regulate blood filtration. The adaptability of smooth muscle is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and responding to the body’s changing needs.
