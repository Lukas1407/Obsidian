Eukaryotic cells usually have one nucleus, but a few cells types, such as the red blood cell, have no nuclei.
It contains nearly all of the cells genome. 

## Structure
The main structure that makes up the nucleus are the:
1. nuclear envelope
2. a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle
3. nuclear matrix ![[Pasted image 20240130163040.png|500]]
- Nuclear pores are required because the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules
