**Electric charge** (symbol $q$) can be _positive_ or _negative_. Similarly charged ions repel each other and oppositely charged ions attract each other.

Electric charges produce electric fields,. A moving charge also produces a magnetic field.

Electric charge is a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">conserved property</mark>; the net charge of an isolated system, the quantity of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge, cannot change. 

Negative charge is carried by electrons, and positive charge is carried by the protons in the nuclei of atoms.
