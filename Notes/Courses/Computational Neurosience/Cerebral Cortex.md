The **cerebral cortex** is the outer layer of the [[Cerebrum]] of the [[Brain]].
It is separated into two cortices, by the longitudinal fissure that divides the cerebrum into the left and right [[Cerebral Hemispheres]].

In most mammals, apart from small mammals that have small brains, the cerebral cortex is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">highly folded</mark>, providing a greater surface area in the confined volume of the cranium. The peaks known as **gyri** and the troughs or grooves known as **sulci**.
In the human [[Brain]] the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible from the outside, but buried in the sulci. It is 1.2 mm thick.
The major sulci and gyri mark the divisions of the cerebrum into the [[Lobes of the brain]].
