Also called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">reversal potential</mark>, the membrane potential at which the flow of a particular ion is in a dynamic equilibrium, meaning the outflow is precisely matched by the inflow of that ion.

If the concentration of ions within the cell is identical to that outside of the cell, then the Nernst potential is zero, since any drift of ions due to [[Transmembrane Proteins#Diffusion vs Transport|diffusion]] is balanced by [[Transmembrane Proteins#Diffusion vs Transport|diffusion]] out of the cell.

## Equation
For an ion $A$ of charge $z_A$ with intracellular concentration $[A_{in}]$ and extracellular concentration $[A_{out}]$, the Nernst potential of that ion is given by:
$$
E_{A}= \frac{k_BT}{z_aq_e}ln(\frac{A_{out}}{A_{in}}),
$$
where $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]], which converts the units of temperature to units of thermal energy, and $q_e$ is the fundamental electronic change (e.i. the charge if an electron).

## Flow of ions 
- If the Nerst Potential is more positive than the [[Membrane potential]], <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">positive ions will flow out</mark> of the cell or <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">negative ions will flow into</mark> the cell.
- If the Nerst Potential is more negative than the [[Membrane potential]], <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">positive ions will flow inzo</mark> the cell or <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">negative ions will flow out</mark> of the cell.
- -> This is why its called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">reversal potential</mark>
