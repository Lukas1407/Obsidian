Also known as equilibrium potential or leak potential, is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell.
Most often, the resting potential is a membrane potential value of-70 mV.
	-> dominant channels transmit either positive ions with a high internal concentration or negative ions with a high external concentration
