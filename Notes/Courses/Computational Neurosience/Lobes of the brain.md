The **lobes of the brain** are the major identifiable zones of the human [[Cerebral Cortex]]. 
The four major lobes are the:
1. [[Lobes of the brain#Frontal Lobe|Frontal Lobe]]
2. [[Lobes of the brain#Parietal Lobe|Parietal Lobe]]
3. [[Lobes of the brain#Occipital Lobe|Occipital Lobe]]
4. [[Lobes of the brain#Temporal Lobe|Temporal Lobe]]

## Frontal Lobe
The frontal lobe is the largest of the four major lobes of the brain, and is located at the front of each [[Cerebral Hemispheres|cerebral hemisphere]].
### Function
It is devoted to action of one kind or another: skeletal movement, ocular movement, speech control, and the expression of emotions. In humans, the largest part of the frontal cortex, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is responsible for internal, purposeful mental action, commonly called reasoning.

## Parietal Lobe
The parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various modalities, including spatial sense and navigation ([[Proprioception]]). The major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, and pain receptors), relay through the [[Thalamus]] to the parietal lobe.

## Occipital Lobe
The occipital lobe is the visual processing center of the [[Brain]] containing most of the anatomical region of the [[Visual Cortex]].

## Temporal Lobe
The temporal lobe is involved in processing sensory input into derived meanings for the appropriate retention of visual memory, language comprehension, and emotion association.
