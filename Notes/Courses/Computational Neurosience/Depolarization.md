**Depolarization** or **hypopolarization** is a change within a cell during which the cell undergoes a shift in electric charge distribution, resulting in less negative charge inside the cell compared to the outside.

## Depolarization inside the Action Potential
In the process of depolarization, the negative internal charge of the cell temporarily becomes more positive (less negative). This shift from a negative to a more positive membrane potential occurs during several processes, including an [[Action Potential]]. During an action potential, the depolarization is so large that the potential difference across the cell membrane briefly reverses polarity, with the inside of the cell becoming positively charged.
