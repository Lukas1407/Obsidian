**Voltage** (symbolÂ $V$) is the difference in [[Electric Potential]] between two points.

## In Biology
Significant potential difference arises between the inner and outer surface of the [[Zellmembran|cell's membrane]] of [[Neuron|neurons]].
Within the cell, smaller differences arise because the charge can more easily flow to balance out such differences.
