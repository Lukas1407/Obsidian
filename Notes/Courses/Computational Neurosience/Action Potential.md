Action potentials in neurons are also known as "**nerve impulses**" or "**spikes**", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its "**spike train**". A neuron that emits an action potential, or nerve impulse, is often said to "fire".
An **action potential** occurs when the [[Membrane potential]] of a [[Neuron]] rapidly rises and falls.
## Generation
- Generated by special types of voltage-gated ion channels inside the cell's [[Zellmembran|membrane]] 
- These channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the (negative) resting potential of the cell, but they rapidly begin to open if the [[Membrane potential]] increases to a precisely defined threshold voltage, [[Depolarization|depolarization]] the transmembrane potential.
- When the [[Ion Channels]] open, they allow an inward flow of sodium ions, which changes the electrochemical gradient, which in turn produces a further rise in the membrane potential towards zero. This then causes more channels to open, producing a greater electric current across the cell membrane and so on. The process proceeds explosively until all of the available [[Ion Channels]] are open, resulting in a large upswing in the membrane potential. The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the polarity of the plasma membrane to reverse, and the ion channels then rapidly inactivate. As the sodium channels close, sodium ions can no longer enter the neuron, and they are then actively transported back out of the plasma membrane. Potassium channels are then activated, and there is an outward current of potassium ions, returning the electrochemical gradient to the [[Resting Potential|resting state]]. After an action potential has occurred, there is a transient negative shift, called the [[Depolarization#^123da2|afterhyperpolarization]].
-> Action potentials are triggered when enough [[Depolarization|depolarization]] accumulates to bring the [[Membrane potential]] up to threshold.
- In most [[Neuron|neurons]], the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second. Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second. However, some types are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.
- Die Ausbildung eines Folgepotenzial kann erst nach der Refraktärzeit erfolgen
	-  absolute Refraktärzeit = Dauer der Inaktivierung der Na+-Kanäle, ca. 1-2ms. Kein erneutes AP möglich. 
	- relative Refraktärzeit = Dauer der Öffnung der K+-Kanäle, ca 1-2ms. Schwellwert für neue AP erhöht.
