### 1-Step Return
- **Formula**: $y_t^{[1]} = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a')$
- **Explanation**: This is the standard update target in basic Q-learning, where the return is estimated using the immediate reward plus the discounted value of the best next action, as predicted by the current Q-function.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - **Low Variance**: Since it only involves one transition and reward, the estimate is relatively stable.
  - **High Bias**: The estimate heavily depends on the current Q-function, which may be inaccurate especially in the early stages of learning.

### 2-Step Return
- **Formula**: $y_t^{[2]} = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma r(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) + \gamma^2 \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+2}, a')$
- **Explanation**: This extends the 1-step return by incorporating the reward and state information from the next step as well. It reduces reliance on the current Q-function by delaying part of the return's dependency to the subsequent step.
- **Benefits**: It starts to reduce the bias by incorporating more actual rewards from the environment, although at the cost of slightly increased variance due to the additional step.

### T-Step Return (Monte Carlo Return)
- **Formula**: $y_t^{[n]} = \sum_{k=t}^{t+T} \gamma^{k-t} r(s_k, a_k)$
- **Explanation**: This return calculates the sum of rewards collected over T steps, fully leveraging actual rewards received and discarding dependency on Q-value predictions beyond this horizon.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - **No Bias**: It uses true rewards up to T steps, providing an unbiased estimate of the state-action value if T spans the entire episode (i.e., Monte Carlo method).
  - **High Variance**: More steps mean more variance in the return estimate, as it accumulates randomness from more steps and rewards.

### Finding the Sweet Spot
- **Typically 5 to 10 Steps**: The idea here is to balance the bias and variance trade-offs. Using a moderate number of steps (neither too few nor too many) helps to:
  - Reduce the dependency on potentially inaccurate Q-values (thus reducing bias).
  - Avoid excessive variance that comes with using too many steps.
