- Add Detection Head?
- Train each task separately and then show how much better it is together?
	- Or what task combination works the best?
	- Makes more sense because all heads for semantic segmentation are basically the same 

- We actually use transfer learning (pertrained from ImageNet) -> wirte about that similar to Deep learning-based multi-task prediction system for plant disease and species detection

## Things we can do with leaf instances
- leaf count
- We can easily adapt to  counting other things like apples, etc as it is proven that it works well in various domains (unclear for the other papers)
- biomass?
- Detect areas of diseases not just if a disease is present
With a model capable of instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, detection, and classification, you can assess a variety of plant parameters across different levels of detail. Here are some specific parameters you can evaluate using this multi-task model:

### 1. **Leaf Count (Instance Segmentation)**
   - Using **instance segmentation**, you can identify individual leaves and count them to assess plant growth or health.
### 2. **Leaf Area (Instance Segmentation or Semantic Segmentation)**
   - You can segment individual leaves (instance segmentation) or the entire leaf canopy (semantic segmentation) to compute the **leaf area** or **projected leaf area (PLA)**.
### 3. **Leaf Shape and Size (Instance Segmentation)**
   - By isolating each leaf instance, you can assess leaf shapes, lengths, widths, and aspect ratios to study shape variations.
### 4. **Leaf Health (Semantic Segmentation or Classification)**
   - You can segment damaged or unhealthy parts of leaves using **semantic segmentation** (e.g., for fungi or disease spots). **Classification** can help assess the health of a leaf by identifying diseases or deficiencies.
### 5. **Fungal or Disease Spread (Semantic Segmentation or Classification)**
   - For identifying the spread of **fungal infections**, diseases, or pests on leaves, semantic segmentation can localize affected areas, while classification can identify the type of disease.
### 6. **Plant Height and Canopy Structure (Detection or Semantic Segmentation)**
   - You can use detection to track and measure the **height** of the plant or its key features (stems, branches). Canopy structure can be mapped using semantic segmentation, allowing you to evaluate its volume and shape.
### 7. **Flower and Fruit Count (Instance Segmentation or Detection)**
   - For counting flowers or fruits on a plant, you can leverage instance segmentation to identify and count them individually, or use detection methods.
### 8. **Fungal or Pest Infestation (Semantic Segmentation or Classification)**
   - The model can be used to **classify or segment fungal, pest, or insect infestations** across the plantâ€™s surface, helping to assess the severity and extent of the problem.
### 9. **Stem and Root Structure (Instance or Semantic Segmentation)**
   - For identifying and analyzing the structure of **stems** or **roots** (in visible images or X-ray/CT scans), instance segmentation can help differentiate between parts.
### 10. **Foliage Density and Leaf Overlap (Instance Segmentation)**
   - By identifying individual leaves using instance segmentation, you can analyze **foliage density** and how much leaves overlap, which is important for studying light absorption and photosynthesis.
### 11. **Object Detection for Reproductive Stages (Detection and Classification)**
   - Using detection and classification, you can identify the presence and count of reproductive organs like flowers or seed pods, helping in the analysis of reproductive stages.
### 12. **Object Classification for Species or Varieties (Classification)**
   - The model can classify different **species or plant varieties**, enabling large-scale phenotyping across different types of plants in mixed crops or natural habitats.
### 13. **Phenotypic Traits (Combination of Tasks)**
   - Using the combination of segmentation and classification, you can assess complex **phenotypic traits** such as plant architecture (how leaves, stems, and branches are organized), disease resistance, and growth efficiency.
