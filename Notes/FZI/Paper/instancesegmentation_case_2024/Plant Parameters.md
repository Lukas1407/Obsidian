1. **Projected Leaf Area (PLA)**: The two-dimensional surface area of leaves as seen from above. It's a common metric used to estimate the canopy cover of a plant.
2. **Leaf Count**: The total number of leaves on the plant, often used to assess growth stages and health.
3. **Biomass**: The total mass of plant material, which can be separated into:
    - **Above-ground biomass**: The mass of the plant parts above the soil, including stems, leaves, and flowers.
    - **Below-ground biomass**: The mass of the root system.
4. **Leaf Area Index (LAI)**: The ratio of leaf surface area to ground surface area. It is used to describe the density of foliage and how effectively a plant intercepts sunlight.
5. **Chlorophyll Content**: This measures the amount of chlorophyll in the plant's leaves, giving an indication of the plant’s photosynthetic capacity and health.
6. **Plant Height**: The vertical distance from the soil level to the tip of the highest part of the plant.
7. **Stem Diameter**: The thickness of the plant's stem, which can be correlated with structural integrity and health.
8. **Leaf Thickness**: The thickness of leaves, which can be related to water content and overall health.
9. **Canopy Volume**: A three-dimensional assessment of the space occupied by the plant's canopy, providing an understanding of the plant's spatial expansion.
10. **Leaf Shape Index**: A ratio describing the leaf's width to length, which can vary by species and environmental conditions.
11. **Root System Architecture (RSA)**: The arrangement and structure of a plant’s roots, which can be evaluated through parameters like root length, root surface area, and root branching patterns.
12. **Water Content**: The amount of water retained in the plant tissues, often used to assess hydration and turgidity.
13. **Photosynthetic Rate**: A measure of how effectively a plant converts light energy into chemical energy via photosynthesis.
14. **Transpiration Rate**: The rate at which water vapor is lost from the plant through the stomata, giving insights into water use efficiency and drought response.
15. **Dry Weight**: The mass of the plant material after all water has been removed. This is another way to assess plant biomass, particularly in research settings.
16. **Carbon Assimilation Rate**: This measures the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the plant for photosynthesis, reflecting overall plant growth and productivity.
17. **Flower Count**: The number of flowers produced by the plant, often linked to reproductive success.
18. **Senescence**: The process of aging in plants, assessed through parameters like leaf yellowing and loss of chlorophyll.
19. **Stomatal Conductance**: The rate of gas exchange through the plant's stomata, often linked to photosynthetic activity and water regulation.
20. **Fruit Yield**: For fruit-bearing plants, this measures the quantity and size of fruits produced.
