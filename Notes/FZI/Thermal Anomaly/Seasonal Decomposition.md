**Explanation**:
   - Decomposes a time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Helps to isolate irregularities that could indicate anomalies.

**Application**:
   - Apply seasonal decomposition (e.g., using STL decomposition) to the temperature time series.
   - Analyze the residual component for anomalies. Large deviations in residuals indicate anomalies.

     ```python
     import statsmodels.api as sm

     decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(temperatures, model='additive', period=12)
     residuals = decomposition.resid
     anomalies = np.where(np.abs(residuals) > threshold)  # Define your threshold
     ```
