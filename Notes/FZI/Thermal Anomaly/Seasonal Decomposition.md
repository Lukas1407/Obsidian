**Explanation**:
   - Decomposes a time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Helps to isolate irregularities that could indicate anomalies.

**Application**:
   - Apply seasonal decomposition (e.g., using STL decomposition) to the temperature time series.
   - Analyze the residual component for anomalies. Large deviations in residuals indicate anomalies.

     ```python
     import statsmodels.api as sm

     decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(temperatures, model='additive', period=12)
     residuals = decomposition.resid
     anomalies = np.where(np.abs(residuals) > threshold)  # Define your threshold
     ```
### Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL)

#### Overview
Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) is a method used to decompose a time series into three main components: seasonal, trend, and residual (or remainder). This decomposition helps in understanding and analyzing the underlying patterns in the data.

#### Components
1. **Trend Component**
   - Captures the long-term progression of the series (e.g., upward or downward movement over time).
   - Reflects the overall direction in which the temperature measurements are moving.

2. **Seasonal Component**
   - Captures the repeating short-term cycle in the data (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly seasonality).
   - Shows regular patterns that repeat over a fixed period.

3. **Residual Component**
   - Represents the remaining part of the series after removing the trend and seasonal components.
   - Contains the irregular or random noise and any anomalies present in the data.

#### Steps to Perform STL Decomposition

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect n temperature measurements $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n$.
   - Ensure the data is in a time series format with consistent time steps.

2. **Apply STL Decomposition**
   - Use statistical software to decompose the time series.
   - Example in Python using `statsmodels` library:
     ```python
     import statsmodels.api as sm
     decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(temperature_data, model='additive', period=seasonal_period)
     trend = decomposition.trend
     seasonal = decomposition.seasonal
     residual = decomposition.resid
     decomposition.plot()
     ```
     Here, `seasonal_period` is the period of the seasonality (e.g., 24 for hourly data with daily seasonality).

3. **Analyze Components**
   - Plot and inspect the trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Anomalies can be detected in the residual component by identifying large deviations or outliers.

#### Example Application
Suppose you have hourly temperature measurements for an object over a month (720 hours).

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the data is hourly and covers the entire period.
2. **Apply STL Decomposition**: 
   ```python
   import statsmodels.api as sm
   decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(temperature_data, model='additive', period=24)
   trend = decomposition.trend
   seasonal = decomposition.seasonal
   residual = decomposition.resid
   decomposition.plot()
   ```
3. **Analyze Components**: Check the residual component for anomalies.
