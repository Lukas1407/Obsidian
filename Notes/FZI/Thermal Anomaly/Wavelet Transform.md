Wavelet Transform is a powerful mathematical tool used to analyze localized variations of power within a time series. Unlike Fourier Transform, which analyzes the frequency content of the entire signal, Wavelet Transform can provide both time and frequency information, making it particularly useful for detecting sudden changes or anomalies in time series data such as temperature measurements.
#### Key Concepts
1. **Wavelet Function**
   - A wavelet is a small wave that grows and decays in a limited time period. It is used as a basis function to analyze the time series data.
   - Common wavelets include the Haar wavelet, Daubechies wavelet, and Morlet wavelet.

2. **Scaling and Translation**
   - **Scaling** (dilation) compresses or stretches the wavelet, allowing the analysis of high and low-frequency components.
   - **Translation** shifts the wavelet along the time axis to analyze different parts of the time series.

3. **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)**
   - CWT provides a continuous spectrum of wavelet coefficients for every scale and position, giving detailed time-frequency analysis.

4. **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**
   - DWT provides a more computationally efficient way to analyze the signal by using a finite set of scales and positions. It is commonly used in practice.

#### Steps to Use Wavelet Transform for Anomaly Detection

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect n temperature measurements $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n$.
   - Ensure the data is in a time series format with consistent time steps.

2. **Choose a Wavelet Function**
   - Select an appropriate wavelet function based on the characteristics of the temperature data. Common choices are Haar, Daubechies, or Morlet wavelets.

3. **Apply Wavelet Transform**
   - Perform the wavelet transform on the temperature data to obtain the wavelet coefficients.
   - Example in Python using `pywt` library:
     ```python
     import pywt
     import numpy as np
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     # Temperature data
     temperature_data = np.array([your_temperature_data])

     # Choose wavelet function
     wavelet = 'db1'  # Daubechies wavelet

     # Perform Discrete Wavelet Transform
     coeffs = pywt.wavedec(temperature_data, wavelet)

     # Reconstruct the signal from wavelet coefficients
     reconstructed_signal = pywt.waverec(coeffs, wavelet)

     # Plot original and reconstructed signals
     plt.plot(temperature_data, label='Original')
     plt.plot(reconstructed_signal, label='Reconstructed')
     plt.legend()
     plt.show()
     ```

4. **Analyze Wavelet Coefficients**
   - The wavelet coefficients at different scales provide information about sudden changes or anomalies.
   - Sudden spikes or large values in the wavelet coefficients indicate anomalies in the temperature data.

5. **Detect Anomalies**
   - Identify anomalies by analyzing the wavelet coefficients at different scales.
   - Significant deviations in the coefficients can indicate sudden changes or anomalies.

#### Example Application
Suppose you have hourly temperature measurements for an object over a month (720 hours), and you want to detect sudden changes.

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the data is hourly and covers the entire period.
2. **Choose a Wavelet Function**: Select the Daubechies wavelet (`db1`).
3. **Apply Wavelet Transform**:
   ```python
   import pywt
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Example temperature data (replace with actual data)
   temperature_data = np.random.normal(20, 5, 720)  # Simulated data

   # Choose wavelet function
   wavelet = 'db1'

   # Perform Discrete Wavelet Transform
   coeffs = pywt.wavedec(temperature_data, wavelet)

   # Reconstruct the signal from wavelet coefficients
   reconstructed_signal = pywt.waverec(coeffs, wavelet)

   # Plot original and reconstructed signals
   plt.plot(temperature_data, label='Original')
   plt.plot(reconstructed_signal, label='Reconstructed')
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```
4. **Analyze Wavelet Coefficients**:
   - Plot the wavelet coefficients at different scales.
   - Identify large spikes or sudden changes in the coefficients.

5. **Detect Anomalies**:
   - Significant deviations in the wavelet coefficients at different scales indicate potential anomalies.
   - Example of plotting wavelet coefficients:
     ```python
     # Plot wavelet coefficients
     for i, coeff in enumerate(coeffs):
         plt.plot(coeff, label=f'Level {i+1}')
     plt.legend()
     plt.show()
     ```

By using Wavelet Transform, you can effectively detect sudden changes or anomalies in temperature data, leveraging the ability to analyze the data at multiple scales and time intervals.
