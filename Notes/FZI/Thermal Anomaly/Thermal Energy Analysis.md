Thermal Energy Analysis involves calculating the thermal energy changes of an object over time to detect sudden spikes or drops that could indicate anomalies. This method leverages the relationship between temperature and thermal energy to monitor and identify unusual patterns or events.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Thermal Energy**
   - Thermal energy is the total internal energy of an object due to the kinetic energy of its molecules.
   - It is directly related to the temperature of the object.

2. **Heat Capacity**
   - The heat capacity (C) of an object is the amount of heat required to change its temperature by one degree.
   - For a given mass (m) and specific heat capacity (c), the heat capacity is given by:
     $$
     C = mc
     $$

3. **Thermal Energy Change**
   - The change in thermal energy (ΔQ) can be calculated as:
     $$
     \Delta Q = C \Delta T
     $$
     where $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

#### Steps to Perform Thermal Energy Analysis

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect n temperature measurements $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n$ over consistent time intervals.
   - Determine or estimate the heat capacity (C) of the object being measured.

2. **Calculate Temperature Changes**
   - Calculate the change in temperature ($\Delta T$) between consecutive measurements:
     $$
     \Delta T_i = T_{i+1} - T_i
     $$
     for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$.

3. **Calculate Thermal Energy Changes**
   - Calculate the change in thermal energy ($\Delta Q$) using the heat capacity:
     $$
     \Delta Q_i = C \Delta T_i
     $$
     for each time step $i$.

4. **Analyze Thermal Energy Changes**
   - Plot the thermal energy changes over time.
   - Identify sudden spikes or drops in the thermal energy changes as potential anomalies.

#### Example Application

Suppose you have hourly temperature measurements for an object over a week (168 hours) and the heat capacity of the object is known.

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the data is hourly and covers the entire period.
2. **Calculate Temperature Changes**:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Example temperature data (replace with actual data)
   temperature_data = np.random.normal(20, 5, 168)

   # Calculate temperature changes
   delta_t = np.diff(temperature_data)
   ```

3. **Calculate Thermal Energy Changes**:
   ```python
   # Assume heat capacity C is known
   C = 1000  # Example heat capacity in J/°C

   # Calculate thermal energy changes
   delta_q = C * delta_t

   # Plot thermal energy changes
   plt.plot(delta_q, label='Thermal Energy Change')
   plt.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='--')
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```

4. **Analyze Thermal Energy Changes**:
   - Identify significant spikes or drops in the thermal energy changes as potential anomalies.

#### Detailed Example

Let's consider the same example in more detail, with hourly temperature measurements over a week and a specific heat capacity.

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect 168 hourly temperature measurements.
2. **Calculate Temperature Changes**:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Example temperature data (replace with actual data)
   temperature_data = np.array([15, 16, 18, 20, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 24, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23,
                                24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 16, 18, 
                                20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 
                                16, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 
                                20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 
                                24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 29, 
                                28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 
                                28, 29, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15])

   # Calculate temperature changes
   delta_t = np.diff(temperature_data)
   ```

3. **Calculate Thermal Energy Changes**:
   ```python
   # Assume heat capacity C is known
   C = 1000  # Example heat capacity in J/°C

   # Calculate thermal energy changes
   delta_q = C * delta_t

   # Plot thermal energy changes
   plt.plot(delta_q, label='Thermal Energy Change')
   plt.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='--')
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```

4. **Analyze Thermal Energy Changes**:
   - Identify significant spikes or drops in the thermal energy changes as potential anomalies.
   - Example of analyzing and identifying anomalies:
     ```python
     # Identify anomalies
     threshold = 5000  # Example threshold for significant change
     anomalies = np.where(np.abs(delta_q) > threshold)[0]

     # Plot anomalies
     plt.plot(delta_q, label='Thermal Energy Change')
     plt.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='--')
     plt.scatter(anomalies, delta_q[anomalies], color='red', label='Anomalies')
     plt.legend()
     plt.show()
     ```

By performing Thermal Energy Analysis, you can effectively monitor changes in thermal energy and detect sudden spikes or drops, helping to identify potential anomalies in temperature data.
